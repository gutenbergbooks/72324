</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Whilst</span> midway in his thirty-fifth year
Lowell was appointed to deliver a course
of lectures before the Institute founded
by a relative, and bearing the family name. He
was then known as the author of two volumes of
poems besides the biting “Fable for Critics” and
the tender “Vision of Sir Launfal,” and the nimbus
was still brightly shining around the head of him
who had created the tuneful “Hosea Biglow” and
the erudite “Parson Wilbur.” It was not the accident
of relationship that procured this appointment;
he had fairly earned the honor by his
scholarly acquirements and poetly achievements.</p>

<p>When the twelfth and last lecture had been delivered,
the correspondent of the “New York
Evening Post” wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Lowell has completed his course of lectures
on English Poetry, which have been attended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
throughout by crowded audiences of the highest
intelligence. The verdict of his hearers has been a
unanimous one of approval and delight. Certainly
no course of literary lectures has ever been delivered
here so overflowing with vigorous, serious
thought, with sound criticism, noble, manly sentiments,
and genuine poetry. Mr. Lowell is a poet,
and how could a true poet speak otherwise?</p>

<p>“His appointment to the Professorship of Belles
Lettres in Harvard College, made vacant by the
resignation of Longfellow, is the very best that
could have been made, and gives high satisfaction.
It is such names that are a tower of strength and
a crown of glory to our Alma Mater. Everett,
Sparks, Ticknor, Longfellow, Agassiz, Peirce, are
known in their respective departments wherever
science and polite letters have a foothold, and the
nomination of James Russell Lowell as the associate
and successor of such men is the most ‘fit to
be made.’”</p>
</div>

<p>A quarter of a century after their delivery, one
who heard them bore this testimony: “The lectures
made a deep impression upon cultivated
auditors, and full reports of them were printed in
the Boston ‘Advertiser.’ Their success was due
to their intrinsic merits. The popular lecturer is
often led to imitate the vehement action of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
stump-speaker and the drollery of the comedian
by turns. Mr. Lowell’s pronunciation is clear
and precise, and the modulations of his voice unstudied
and agreeable, but he seldom if ever raised
a hand for gesticulation, and his voice was kept in
its natural compass. He read like one who had
something of importance to utter, and the just emphasis
was felt in the penetrating tone. There
were no oratorical climaxes, and no pitfalls set for
applause. But the weighty thoughts, the earnest
feeling, and the brilliant poetical images gave to
every discourse an indescribable charm. The
younger portion of the audience, especially, enjoyed
a feast for which all the study of their lives
had been a preparation.”</p>

<p>The same auditor, writing after Lowell’s death,
mentions them again: “In 1854 [it was really
1855] Lowell delivered a course of twelve lectures
on the British Poets at the Lowell Institute. They
were not printed at the time, except, partially, in
newspaper reports, but doubtless many of their
ideas were absorbed in the published essays. In
these lectures the qualities of his prose style began
to be manifested. It was felt by every hearer to
be the prose of a poet, as it teemed with original
images, fortunate epithets, and artistically wrought
allusions, and had a movement and music all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
own. A few friends from Cambridge attended these
lectures, walking into the city, and more than once
through deep snow. The lecturer humorously acknowledged
his indebtedness to them, saying that
when he saw their faces he was in the presence of
his literary conscience. These lectures have not
been published as yet, and may not be.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Even while they were yet ringing in the ears of
those delighted audiences, Ticknor and Fields were
eager to publish them, but Lowell withheld consent.
The lectures had been rapidly written, and needed
the labor of the file, and this the unexpected duties
of the equally unexpected professorship precluded.
There were five applicants for the chair vacated by
Longfellow, but Lowell was not one of them; both
his nomination and his appointment were made
without his knowledge. He accepted the chair with
the understanding that he should be allowed to
spend one year abroad for some necessary study in
Germany and Spain. Then his professorial duties
engaged him and the “Lectures on English Poets”
were left as a waif stranded on the forgotten columns
of a newspaper. When at length the opportunity
of leisure came Lowell found himself capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
of better things, and he was satisfied with absorbing
into later essays some fragments of the early lectures.
There ended his concern for them; but an
enthusiastic hearer had preserved the Boston “Advertiser’s”
reports of them in a special scrap-book,
which ultimately became the property of the University
of Michigan and thus fell into the editor’s
hands, who felt the charm thereof, and was desirous
of sharing his pleasure with the <i>Rowfant Club</i>.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that Lowell had been too fastidious
when he wrote to James T. Fields, in May,
1855: “It has just got through my skull, and made
a dint into my sensorium, that you wrote me a note,
ever so long ago, about my lectures and the publication
of them. I don’t mean to print them yet—nor
ever till they are better—but, at any rate, I consider
myself one of your flock, though not, perhaps,
as lanigerous as some of them.” And when Lowell’s
literary executor wrote: “His powers of critical appreciation
and reflection were displayed to advantage
in these lectures. No such discourses had been
heard in America. They added greatly to his reputation
as critic, scholar, and poet,”—there could be
no hesitation in setting aside Lowell’s modest self-depreciation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
After the delivery of his first lecture,
he had written to his friend Stillman: “So far as the
public are concerned, I have succeeded.” And his
words are as true in 1896 as they were in 1855; and
although his literary art was not so consummate as
it became in his ultimate development, these early
lectures will aid and encourage the student by showing
his growth: we see the rivulet become the flowing
river.</p>

<p>We share, too, in the delight of his first audience
on reading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The lines of Dante seem to answer his every
mood: sometimes they have the compressed implacability
of his lips, sometimes they ring like an angry
gauntlet thrown down in defiance, and sometimes
they soften or tremble as if that stern nature would
let its depth of pity show itself only in a quiver of
the voice.”</p>

<p>“So in ‘Paradise Lost’ not only is there the pomp
of long passages that move with the stately glitter
of Milton’s own angelic squadrons, but if you meet
anywhere a single verse, that, too, is obstinately
epic, and you recognize it by its march as certainly
as you know a friend by his walk.”</p>

<p>“Who can doubt the innate charm of rhyme
whose eye has ever been delighted by the visible
consonance of a tree growing at once toward an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
upward and a downward heaven, on the edge of the
unrippled river; or as the kingfisher flits from shore
to shore, his silent echo flies under him and completes
the vanishing couplet in the visionary world
below.”</p>

<p>“Every desire of the heart finds its gratification
in the poet because he always speaks imaginatively
and satisfies ideal hungers.”</p>
</div>

<p>And see, too, how the “powers of critical appreciation”
that Professor Norton has mentioned were
bursting into blossom and giving promise of the
golden harvest to come:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sir Thomas Browne, * * * a man
who gives proof of more imagination than any other
Englishman except Shakspeare.”</p>
</div>

<p>For subtlety and depth of insight Lowell has
never excelled this early example, nor has he ever
outdone the critical estimate, so true and so terse,
of his final pronouncement upon Pope:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Measured by any high standard of imagination,
he will be found wanting; tried by any test of wit,
he is unrivaled.”</p>
</div>

<p>And what of such a shining felicity as where he
meets Sir Thomas Browne on common ground and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
the author of “Religio Medici” gravely smiles and
acknowledges kinship:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If a naturalist showed us a toad we should feel
indifferent, but if he told us that it had been found
in a block of granite we should instantly look with
profound interest on a creature that perhaps ate
moths in Abel’s garden or hopped out of the path
of Lamech.”</p>
</div>

<p>Most truly “No such lectures had been heard in
America,” and as truly they deserve to be made
more than a delightful memory for the early
hearers alone.</p>

<p>Lowell wrote to a friend that at his first lecture
he had held his audience for an hour and a quarter,
but the reporter’s notes of that lecture fall far
short of that fullness; nevertheless, compared with
Anstey’s shorthand notes of Carlyle’s lectures on
the “History of Literature,” we come much nearer
to the living voice in the Boston “Advertiser’s”
reports of these Lowell lectures. Carlyle spoke
without a written text, nor had he any notes save a
few bits of paper which in his hyper-nervousness he
twisted out of all hope of reportorial decipherment—and
without once looking at them; Lowell had his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
manuscripts (written <i>currente calamo</i>, for the new
wine of life was in full ferment and it was no small
feat to bottle any of it successfully), and we are assured
from internal evidence that the “Advertiser’s”
reporter was allowed access to them. His
text has a <i>tang</i> as characteristic as Thoreau’s wild
apples, and we do not feel the dubiety of the blind
patriarch, “The voice is Jacob’s, but the hands are
Esau’s.” No; it is James Russell Lowell, his voice,
his inimitable mark, and these are his words sounding
in our ears after half a century.</p>

<p>The only attempt at “editing” has been as far as
possible to reproduce the reporter’s “copy.” To that
end Lowell’s profusion of capitals is retained (and
the reader will bear in mind that the Transcendental
spirit was then in both the air and the alphabet),
and even his italics, suggested, as Mr. Underwood
says, by the speaker’s emphasis, find their respective
places. Here and there a compositor’s error has
been corrected and a proof-reader’s oversight adjusted;
sometimes this has been conjectural, and
again the needful change was obvious. In all else,
save the applause, this Rowfant Book may be called
a faint echo of the Lowell Institute Lectures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span></p>

<p>It is “printed, but not published” in loving fealty
to Lowell’s memory, and every Rowfanter has at
heart the assurance that his Shade will look upon
this literary <i>flotsam</i> without a frown, or with one
that will soon fade into forgiveness.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell began by expressing his sense of
the responsibility he had assumed in undertaking
a course of lectures on English Poets. Few
men, he said, had in them twelve hours of talk that
would be worth hearing on <i>any</i> subject; but on a
subject like poetry no person could hope to combine
in himself the qualities that would enable him to
do justice to his theme. A lecturer on science has
only to show how much he knows—the lecturer
on Poetry can only be sure how much he <i>feels</i>.</p>

<p>Almost everybody has a fixed opinion about the
merits of certain poets which he does not like to
have disturbed. There are no fanaticisms so ardent
as those of Taste, especially in this country, where
we are so accustomed to settle everything by vote
that if a majority should decide to put a stop to the
precession of the Equinoxes we should expect to
hear no more of that interesting ceremony.</p>

<p>A distinguished woman [Mrs. Stowe] who has
lately published a volume of travels, affirms that it
is as easy to judge of painting as of poetry by instinct.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
It <i>is</i> as easy. But without reverent study
of their works no instinct is competent to judge
of the masters of either art.</p>

<p>Yet every one has a right to his private opinion,
and the critic should deal tenderly with illusions
which give men innocent pleasure. You may
sometime see japonicas carved out of turnips, and
if a near-sighted friend should exclaim, “What a
pretty japonica!” do not growl “Turnip!” unless,
on discovering his mistake, he endeavors to prove
that the imitation is as good as the real flower.</p>

<p>In whatever I shall say, continued Mr. Lowell,
I shall, at least, have done my best to think before
I speak, making no attempt to say anything new,
for it is only strange things and not new ones that
come by effort. In looking up among the starry
poets I have no hope of discovering a new Kepler’s
law—one must leave such things to great mathematicians
like Peirce. I shall be content with resolving
a nebula or so, and bringing to notice some
rarer shade of color in a double star. In our day
a lecturer can hardly hope to instruct. The press
has so diffused intelligence that everybody has just
misinformation enough on every subject to make
him thoroughly uncomfortable at the misinformation
of everybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell then gave a brief outline of his course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
stating that this first lecture would indicate his
point of view, and treat in part of the imaginative
faculty.</p>

<p>After some remarks upon Dr. Johnson’s “Lives
of the Poets,” the lecturer proceeded: Any true
criticism of poetry must start from the axiom that
what distinguishes that which we call the poetical in
anything, and makes it so, is that it transcends the
understanding, by however little or much, and is
interpreted by the intuitive operation of some quite
other faculty of the mind. It is precisely the something-more
of feeling, of insight, of thought, of expression
which for the moment lulls that hunger
for the superfluous which is the strongest appetite
we have, and which always gives the lie to the
proverb that enough is as good as a feast. The
boys in the street express it justly when they define
the indefinable merit of something which pleases
them, by saying it is a touch beyond—or it is first-rate
and a half. The poetry of a thing is this touch
beyond, this third half on the farther side of first-rate.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson said that that only was good poetry
out of which good prose could be made. But poetry
cannot be translated into prose at all. Its condensed
meaning may be paraphrased, and you get
the sense of it, but lose the condensation which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
a part of its essence. If on Christmas day you
should give your son a half-eagle, and should presently
take it back, and give him the excellent prose
version of five hundred copper cents, the boy would
doubtless feel that the translation had precisely
the same meaning in tops, balls, and gibraltars; but
the feeling of infinite riches in a little room, of being
able to carry in his waistcoat pocket what Dr.
Johnson would have called the potentiality of tops
and balls and gibraltars beyond the dreams of avarice—this
would have evaporated. By <i>good</i> prose
the Doctor meant prose that was sensible and had
a meaning. But he forgot his own theory sometimes
when he thought he was writing poetry.
How would he contrive to make any kind of sense
of what he says of Shakspeare? that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Panting Time toiled after him in vain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The difference between prose and poetry is one
of essence and not one of accident. What may be
called the negatively poetical exists everywhere.
The life of almost every man, however prosaic to
himself, is full of these dumb melodies to his neighbor.
The farmer looks from the hillside and sees
the tall ship lean forward with its desire for the
ocean, every full-hearted sail yearning seaward, and
takes passage with her from his drudgery to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
beautiful conjectured land. Meanwhile he himself
has Pegasus yoked to his plough without knowing
it, and the sailor, looking back, sees him sowing his
field with the graceful idyl of summer and harvest.
Little did the needle-woman dream that she was
stitching passion and pathos into her weary seam,
till Hood came and found them there.</p>

<p>The poetical element may find expression either
in prose or verse. The “Undine” of Fouqué is poetical,
but it is not poetry. A prose writer may have
imagination and fancy in abundance and yet not
be a poet. What is it, then, that peculiarly distinguishes
the poet? It is not merely a sense of the
beautiful, but so much keener <i>joy</i> in the sense of it
(arising from a greater fineness of organization) that
the emotion must <i>sing</i>, instead of only <i>speaking</i> itself.</p>

<p>The first great distinction of poetry is <i>form</i> or
arrangement. This is not confined to poems alone,
but is found involved with the expression of the poetical
in all the Arts. It is here that the statue bids
good-bye to anatomy and passes beyond it into the
region of beauty; that the painter passes out of the
copyist and becomes the Artist.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell here quoted Spenser’s statement of
Plato’s doctrine:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For of the soul the body form doth take,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p>This coördination of the spirit and form of a
poem is especially remarkable in the “Divina Commedia”
of Dante and the “Paradise Lost” of Milton,
and that not only in the general structure, but
in particular parts. The lines of Dante seem to
answer his every mood: sometimes they have the
compressed implacability of his lips, sometimes they
ring like an angry gauntlet thrown down in defiance,
and sometimes they soften or tremble as if
that stern nature would let its depth of pity show
itself only in a quiver of the voice; but always
and everywhere there is subordination, and the
pulse of the measure seems to keep time to the footfall
of the poet along his fated path, as if a fate
were on the verses too. And so in the “Paradise
Lost” not only is there the pomp of long passages
that move with the stately glitter of Milton’s own
angelic squadrons, but if you meet anywhere a
single verse, that, too, is obstinately epic, and you
recognize it by its march as certainly as you know
a friend by his walk.</p>

<p>The instinctive sensitiveness to order and proportion,
this natural incapability of the formless
and vague, seems not only natural to the highest
poetic genius, but to be essential to the universality
and permanence of its influence over the minds of
men. The presence of it makes the charm of Pope’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
“Rape of the Lock” perennial; its absence will always
prevent such poems as the “Faëry Queene,”
“Hudibras,” and the “Excursion” (however full of
beauty, vivacity, and depth of thought) from being
popular.</p>

<p>Voltaire has said that epic poems were discourses
which at first were written in verse only because it
was not yet the custom to narrate in prose. But
instead of believing that verse is an imperfect and
undeveloped prose, it seems much more reasonable
to conclude it the very consummation and fortunate
blossom of speech, as the flower is the perfection
towards which the leaf yearns and climbs, and in
which it at last attains to fullness of beauty, of
honey, of perfume, and the power of reproduction.</p>

<p>There is some organic law of expression which,
as it must have dictated the first formation of language,
must also to a certain extent govern and
modulate its use. That there is such a law a common
drum-head will teach us, for if you cover it
with fine sand and strike it, the particles will arrange
themselves in a certain regular order in sympathy
with its vibrations. So it is well known
that the wood of a violin shows an equal sensibility,
and an old instrument is better than a new one
because all resistance has been overcome. I have
observed, too, as something that distinguishes singing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
birds from birds of prey, that their flight is
made up of a series of parabolic curves, with rests
at regular intervals, produced by a momentary folding
of the wings; as if the law of their being were
in some sort metrical and they <i>flew</i> musically.</p>

<p>Who can doubt the innate charm of rhyme whose
eye has ever been delighted by the visible consonance
of the tree growing at once toward an upward
and a downward heaven on the edge of an
unrippled river; or, as the kingfisher flits from shore
to shore, his silent echo flies under him and completes
the vanishing couplet in the visionary world
below? Who can question the divine validity of
number, proportion, and harmony, who has studied
the various rhythms of the forest? Look for example
at the pine, how its branches, balancing each
other, ray out from the tapering stem in stanza after
stanza, how spray answers to spray, and leaf to leaf
in ordered strophe and antistrophe, till the perfect
tree stands an embodied ode, through which the unthinking
wind cannot wander without finding the
melody that is in it and passing away in music.</p>

<p>Language, as the poets use it, is something more
than an expedient for conveying thought. If mere
meaning were all, then would the Dictionary be always
the most valuable work in any tongue, for in
it exist potentially all eloquence, all wisdom, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
pathos, and all wit. It is a great wild continent of
words ready to be tamed and subjugated, to have
its meanings and uses applied. The prose writer
finds there his quarry and his timber; but the poet
enters it like Orpheus, and makes its wild inmates
sing and dance and keep joyous time to every
wavering fancy of his lyre.</p>

<p>All language is dead invention, and our conversational
currency is one of shells like that of some
African tribes—shells in which poetic thoughts once
housed themselves, and colored with the tints of
morning. But the poet can give back to them their
energy and freshness; can conjure symbolic powers
out of the carnal and the trite. For it is only an
enchanted sleep, a simulated death, that benumbs
language; and see how, when the true prince-poet
comes, the arrested blood and life are set free again
by the touch of his fiery lips, and as Beauty awakens
through all her many-chambered palace runs a thrill
as of creation, giving voice and motion and intelligence
to what but now were dumb and stiffened
images.</p>

<p>The true reception of whatever is poetical or imaginative
presupposes a more exalted, or, at least,
excited, condition of mind both in the poet and the
reader. To take an example from daily life, look at
the wholly diverse emotions with which a partizan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
and an indifferent person read the same political
newspaper. The one thinks the editor a very sound
and moderate person whose opinion is worth having
on a practical question; the other wonders to
see one very respectable citizen drawn as a Jupiter
Tonans, with as near an approach to real thunderbolts
as printer’s ink and paper will concede, and
another, equally respectable and a member of the
same church, painted entirely black, with horns,
hoofs, and tail. The partizan is in the receptive
condition just spoken of; the indifferent occupies
the solid ground of the common sense.</p>

<p>To illustrate the superiority of the poetic imagination
over the prosaic understanding, Mr. Lowell
quoted a story told by Le Grand in a note to one of
his “Fabliaux.” A sinner lies dying, and an angel
and a fiend, after disputing the right to his soul,
agree to settle the affair by a throw of dice. The
fiend gets the first chance, and the fatal cubes come
up—two sixes! He chuckles and rubs his claws,
for everybody knows that no higher number is possible.
But the angel thinks otherwise, throws, and,
behold, a six and seven! And thus it is, that when
the understanding has done its best, when it has
reached, as it thinks, down to the last secret of
music and meaning that language is capable of,
the poetical sense comes in with its careless miracle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and gets one more point than there are in
the dice.</p>

<p>Imagination is not necessarily concerned with
poetic expression. Nothing can be more poetical
than the lines of Henry More the Platonist:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">What doth move</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The nightingale to sing so fresh and clear?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thrush or lark, that mounting high above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chants her shrill notes to heedless ears of corn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heavily hanging in the dewy morn.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But compare it with Keats’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Ruth, when sick for home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She stood in tears amid the <i>alien</i> corn.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The imagination has touched that word “alien,”
and in it we see the field through Ruth’s eyes, as
<i>she</i> looked round on the hostile spikes, and not
through those of the poet.</p>

<p>Imagination enters more or less into the composition
of all <i>great</i> minds, all minds that have what
we call <i>breadth</i> as distinguished from mere force
or acuteness. We find it in philosophers like Plato
and Bacon, in discoverers like Kepler and Newton,
in fanatics like George Fox, and in reformers like
Luther.</p>

<p>The shape which the imaginative faculty will take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
is modified by the force of the other qualities with
which it is coördinated in the mind. If the moral
sense predominates, the man becomes a reformer,
or a fanatic, and his imagination gets itself uttered
in his life. Bunyan would have been nothing but
a fanatic, if he had not been luckily shut up in
Bedford jail, alone with his imagination, which,
unable to find vent in any other way, possessed
and tortured him till it had wrung the “Pilgrim’s
Progress” out of him—a book the nearest to a
poem, without being one, that ever was written.
Uniting itself with the sense of form, Imagination
makes a sculptor; with those of form and color,
a painter; with those of time and tune, a musician.
For in itself it is dumb, and can find expression
only through the help of some other faculty.</p>

<p>Imagination <i>plus</i> the poetic sense is poesy, <i>minus</i>
the poetic sense it is science, though it may clothe
itself in verse. To those who are familiar with Dr.
Donne’s verses, I need only mention his name as a
proof of my last position. He solves problems in
rhyme, that is all.</p>

<p>Shakspeare was so charged with the highest
form of the poetic imagination, as some persons are
with electricity, that he could not point his finger
at a word without a spark of it going out of him.
I will illustrate it by an example taken at random<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
from him. When Romeo is parting from Juliet,
Shakspeare first projects his own mind into Romeo,
and then, as Romeo becomes so possessed with
the emotion of the moment that his words take
color from it, all nature is infected and is full of
<i>partings</i>. He says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But look what <i>envious</i> streaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do lace the <i>severing</i> clouds.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shakspeare’s one hundred and thirteenth sonnet
was here also quoted in illustration.</p>

<p>The highest form of imagination, Mr. Lowell said,
is the dramatic, of which Shakspeare must always
stand for the only definition. Next is the narrative
imagination, where the poet forces his own
personal consciousness upon us and makes our
senses the slaves of his own. Of this kind Dante’s
“Divina Commedia” is the type. Below this are
the poems in which the imagination is more diffused;
where the impression we receive is rather
from <i>mass</i> than from particulars; where single lines
are not so strong in themselves as in forming integral
portions of great sweeps of verse; where
effects are produced by allusion and suggestion, by
sonorousness, by the use of names which have a
traditional poetic value. Of this kind Milton is
the type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Lastly, said Mr. Lowell, I would place in a class
by themselves those poets who have properly no
imagination at all, but only a pictorial power.
These we may call the imaginary poets, writers who
give us images of things that neither they nor we
believe in or can be deceived by, like pictures from
a magic lantern. Of this kind are the Oriental
poems of Southey, which show a knowledge of Asiatic
mythologies, but are not livingly mythologic.</p>

<p>Where the imagination is found in combination
with great acuteness of intellect, we have its secondary
or prose form. Lord Bacon is an example
of it. Sir Thomas Browne is a still more remarkable
one—a man who gives proof of more imagination
than any other Englishman except Shakspeare.</p>

<p>Fancy is a frailer quality than Imagination, and
cannot breathe the difficult air of the higher regions
of intuition. In combination with Sentiment
it produces poetry; with Experience, wit. The
poetical faculty is in closer affinity with Imagination;
the poetical temperament with Fancy. Contrast
Milton with Herrick or Moore. In illustration
Mr. Lowell quoted from Marvell, the poet of all
others whose fancy hints always at something beyond
itself, and whose wit seems to have been fed
on the strong meat of humor.</p>

<p>As regards <i>man</i>, Fancy takes delight in life, manners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and the result of culture, in what may be
called <i>Scenery</i>; Imagination is that mysterious
something which we call Nature—the unfathomed
base on which Scenery rests and is sustained.
Fancy deals with feeling; Imagination with passion.
I have sometimes thought that Shakspeare, in
the scene of the “Tempest,” intended to typify the
isle of <i>Man</i>, and in the characters, some of the leading
qualities or passions which dwell in it. It is
not hard to find the Imagination in Prospero, the
Fancy in Ariel, and the Understanding in Caliban;
and, as he himself was the poetic imagination incarnated,
is it considering too nicely to think that
there is a profound personal allusion in the breaking
of Prospero’s wand and the burying of his book
to the nature of that man who, after such thaumaturgy,
could go down to Stratford and live there
for years, only collecting his dividends from the
Globe Theatre, lending money on mortgage, and
leaning over the gate to chat and chaffer with his
neighbors?</p>

<p>I think that every man is conscious at times that
it is only his borders, his seaboard, that is civilized
and subdued. Behind that narrow strip stretches
the untamed domain, shaggy, unexplored, of the
natural instincts. Is not this so? Then we can narrow
our definition yet farther, and say that Fancy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and Wit appear to the artificial man; Imagination
and Humor to the natural man. Thus each of us
in his dual capacity can at once like Chaucer and
Pope, Butler and Jean Paul, and bury the hatchet
of one war of tastes.</p>

<p>And now, finally, what is the secret of the great
poet’s power over us? There is something we love
better than love, something that is sweeter to us
than riches, something that is more inspiring to us
than success—and that is the imagination of them.
No woman was ever loved enough, no miser was
ever rich enough, no ambitious man ever successful
enough, but in imagination. Every desire of
the heart finds its gratification in the poet because
he speaks always imaginatively and satisfies ideal
hungers. We are the always-welcome guests of his
ennobling words.</p>

<p>This, then, is why the poet has always been held
in reverence among men. All nature is dumb, and
we men have mostly but a stunted and stuttering
speech. But the longing of every created thing is
for utterance and expression. The Poet’s office,
whether we call him Seer, Prophet, Maker, or
Namer, is always this—to be the Voice of this lower
world. Through him, man and nature find at last
a tongue by which they can utter themselves and
speak to each other. The beauties of the visible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
world, the trembling attractions of the invisible,
the hopes and desires of the heart, the aspirations
of the soul, the passions and the charities of men;
nay, the trees, the rocks, our poor old speechless
mother, the earth herself, become voice and music,
and attain to that humanity, a divine instinct of
which is implanted in them all.</p>

<p class="center big">II</p>
</div>


<p>In literature, as in religion and politics, there is
a class of men who may be called Fore-runners.
As there were brave men before Agamemnon, so
there must have been brave poets before Homer.
All of us, the great as well as the little, are the result
of the entire Past. It is but just that we should
remember now and then that the very dust in the
beaten highways of thought is that of perhaps
nameless saints and heroes who thought and suffered
and died to make commonplace practicable to
us. Men went to the scaffold or the stake for ideas
and principles which we set up in our writings and
our talk as thoughtlessly as a printer sticks his
type, and the country editor, when he wrote his last
diatribe on the freedom of the press, dipped his pen
without knowing it in the blood of the martyrs. It
would be well for us to remember, now and then,
our dusty benefactors, and to be conscious that we
are under bonds to the Present to the precise
amount that we are indebted to the Past.</p>

<p>Thus, from one point of view, there is nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
more saddening than a biographical dictionary. It
is like a graveyard of might-have-beens and used-to-be’s,
of fames that never ripened and of fames
already decayed. Here lies the great Thinker who
stammered and could not find the best word for his
best thought, and so the fame went to some other
who had the gift of tongues. Here lies the gatherer
of great masses of learning from which another was
to distil the essence, and to get his name upon all
the phials and show-bills. But if these neglected
headstones preach the vanity of a selfish ambition,
they teach also the better lesson that every man’s
activity belongs not to himself but to his kind,
and whether he will or not must serve at last some
other, greater man. We are all foot-soldiers, and
it is out of the blood of a whole army of us that
iron enough is extracted to make the commemorative
sword that is voted to the great Captain.</p>

<p>In that long aqueduct which brings the water of
life down to us from its far sources in the Past,
though many have done honest day-labor in building
it, yet the keystone that unites the arch of
every period is engraved with the name of the
greatest man alone. These are our landmarks,
and mentally we measure by these rather than by
any scheme of Chronology. If we think of Philosophy,
we think of four or five great names, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
so of Poetry, Astronomy, and the rest. Geology
may give what age she will to the globe; it matters
not, it will still be only so many great men old;
and wanting these, it is in vain that Egypt and Assyria
show us their long bead-roll of vacant centuries.
It is in the life of its great men that the life
and thought of a people becomes statuesque, rises
into poetry, and makes itself sound out clearly in
rhythm and harmony.</p>

<p>These great persons get all the fame and all the
monuments like the generals of armies, though <i>we</i>
may lead the forlorn hope, or make a palpitating
bridge with our bodies in the trenches. Rank and
file may grumble a little—but it is always so, and
always must be so. Fame would not be fame if it
were or could be divided infinitesimally, and every
man get his drachm and scruple. It is good for
nothing unless it come in a lump. And besides, if
every man got a monument or an epitaph who felt
quite sure he deserved it, would marble hold out,
or Latin?</p>

<p>The fame of a great poet is made up of the sum
of all the appreciations of many succeeding generations,
each of which he touches at some one point.
He is like a New World into which explorer after explorer
enters, one to botanize, one to geologize, one
to ethnologize, and each bringing back his report.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
His great snowy mountains perhaps only one man
in a century goes to the top of and comes back to
tell us how he saw from them at once the two great
oceans of Life and Death, the Atlantic out of which
we came, the Pacific toward which we tend.</p>

<p>Of the poet we do not ask everything, but the
best expression of the <i>best</i> of everything. If a man
attain this but once, though only in a frail song,
he is immortal; while every one who falls just
short of it, if only by a hair’s breadth, is as sure
to be forgotten. There is a wonderful secret that
poets have not yet learned, and this is that small
men cannot do great things, but that the small man
who can do small things <i>best</i> is great. The most
fatal ill-success is to almost succeed, as, in Italy,
the worst lemons are those large ones which come
nearest to being oranges. The secret of permanent
fame is to express some idea the most compactly,
whether in your life, your deed, or your writing.
I think that if anything is clear in history, it is
that every idea, whether in morals, politics, or art,
which is laboring to express itself, feels of many
men and throws them aside before it finds the one
in whom it can incarnate itself. The noble idea
of the Papacy (for it <i>was</i> a noble one—nothing
less than the attempt to embody the higher law in
a human institution) whispered itself to many before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
it got the man it wanted in Gregory the Great.
And Protestantism carried numbers to the stake ere
it entered into Luther: a man whom nature made
on purpose—all asbestos so that he could not burn.
Doubtless Apollo spoiled many a reed before he
found one that would do to pipe through even to
the sheep of Admetus, and the land of song is scattered
thick with reeds which the Muse has experimented
with and thrown away.</p>

<p>It is from such a one that I am going to try to
draw a few notes of music and of mirth to-night.
Contemporary with Chaucer lived a man who satirized
the clergy and gave some lively pictures of
manners before the “Canterbury Tales” were written.
His poem was very popular, as appears from
the number of manuscript copies of it remaining,
and after being forgotten for two centuries, it was
revived again, printed, widely read, and helped onward
the Reformation in England. It has been reprinted
twice during the present century. This
assures us that it must have had a good deal of
original force and vivacity. It may be considered,
however, to be tolerably defunct now. This poem
is the vision of Piers Ploughman.</p>

<p>I have no hope of reviving it. Dead poets are
something <i>very</i> dead, and critics blow their trumpets
over them in vain. What I think is interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
and instructive in the poem is that it illustrates in
a remarkable manner what may be considered the
Anglo-Saxon element in English poetry. I refer to
race, and not to language. We find here a vigorous
common-sense, a simple and hearty love of nature,
a certain homely tenderness, held in check always
by a dogged veracity. Instead of Fancy we have
Feeling; and, what more especially deserves notice,
there is almost an entire want of that sense of form
and outline and proportion which alone brings anything
within the province of Art. Imagination
shows itself now and then in little gleams and
flashes, but always in the form of Humor. For the
basis of the Anglo-Saxon mind is beef and beer;
what it considers the <i>real</i> as distinguished from,
or rather opposed to, the <i>ideal</i>. It spares nothing
merely because it is beautiful. It is the Anglo-Saxon
who invented the word <i>Humbug</i>, the potent
exorcism which lays the spirit of poetry in the Red
Sea. It is he who always translates Shows into
Shams.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, “Piers Ploughman’s Vision”
is not a poem at all. It is a sermon rather, for
no verse, the chief end of which is not the representation
of the beautiful, and whose moral is not
included in that, can be called poetry in the true
sense of the word. A thought will become poetical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
by being put into verse when a horse hair will turn
into a snake by being laid in water. The poetical
nature will delight in Mary Magdalen more for her
fine hair than for her penitence. But whatever is
poetical in this book seems to me characteristically
Saxon. The English Muse has mixed blood in her
veins, and I think that what she gets from the
Saxon is a certain something homely and practical,
a flavor of the goodwife which is hereditary. She
is the descendant on one side of Poor Richard, inspired,
it is true, but who always brings her knitting
in her pocket. The light of the soul that
shines through her countenance, that “light that
never was on land or sea,” is mingled with the warm
glow from the fireside on the hearth of Home. Indeed,
may it not be attributed to the Teutonic
heart as something peculiar to it, that it has breadth
enough to embrace at once the chimney-corner and
the far-reaching splendors of Heaven? Happy for
it when the smoke and cookery-steam of the one
do not obscure the other!</p>

<p>I find no fault with the author of Piers Ploughman
for not being a poet. Every man cannot be a
poet (fortunately), nor every poet a great one. It
is the privilege of the great to be always contemporaneous,
to speak of fugacious events in words
that shall be perennial. But to the poets of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
second rate we go for pictures of manners that have
passed away, for transitory facts, for modes of life
and ways of thinking that were circumstantial
merely. They give us reflections of our outward,
as their larger brethren do of our inward, selves.
They deal, as it were, with costume; the other with
man himself.</p>

<p>But these details are of interest, so fond are we
of facts. We all have seen the congregation which
grew sleepy while the preacher talked of the other
world give a stir of pleased attention if he brought
in a personal anecdote about <i>this</i>. Books are written
and printed, and we read them to tell us how
our forefathers cocked their hats, or turned up the
points of their shoes; when blacking and starch
were introduced; who among the Anglo-Saxons
carried the first umbrella, and who borrowed it.</p>

<p>These trifles, also, acquire importance in proportion
as they are older. If a naturalist showed us a
toad, we should be indifferent, but if he told us that
it had been found in a block of granite, we should
instantly look with profound interest on a creature
that perhaps ate moths in Abel’s garden, or hopped
out of the path of Lamech. And the same precious
jewel of instruction we find in the ugly little facts
embedded in early literatures. They teach us the
unchangeableness of man and his real independence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
of his accidents. He is the same old lay figure
under all his draperies, and sits to one artist for a
John and to another for a Judas, and serves equally
well for both portraits. The oldest fable reappears
in the newest novel. Aristophanes makes coats that
fit us still. Voltaire is Lucian translated into the
eighteenth century. Augustus turns up in Louis
Napoleon. The whirligig of Time brings back at
regular intervals the same actors and situations, and
under whatever names—Ormuzd and Ahriman,
Protestantism and Catholicism, Reform and Conservatism,
Transcendentalism and Realism. We
see the same ancient quarrel renewed from generation
to generation, till we begin to doubt whether
this be truly the steps of a Tower of Babel that we
are mounting, and not rather a treadmill, where we
get all the positive good of the exercise and none
of the theoretic ill which might come if we could
once solve the problem of getting above ourselves.
Man’s life continues to be, as the Saxon noble described
it, the flight of a sparrow through a lighted
hall, out of one darkness and into another, and the
two questions <i>whence?</i> and <i>whither?</i> were no tougher
to Adam than to us. The author of Piers Ploughman’s
Vision has offered us his theory of this
world and the next, and in doing so gives some
curious hints of modes of life and of thought. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
generally agreed that one of his names was Langland,
and it is disputed whether the other was
Robert or William. Robert has the most authority,
and William the strongest arguments in its
favor. It is of little consequence now to him or
us. He was probably a monk at Malvern. His
poem is a long one, written in the unrhymed
alliterative measure of the Anglo-Saxon poetry,
and the plan of it is of the simplest kind. It is a
continued allegory, in which all the vices, passions,
and follies of the time, the powers of the mind, the
qualities of the spirit, and the theological dogmas
of the author, are personified and mixed up with
real personages with so much simplicity, and with
such unconscious interfusion of actual life as to
give the whole an air of probability.</p>

<p>The author of Piers Ploughman’s Vision avoids
any appearance of incongruity by laying his scene
in a world which is neither wholly real nor
wholly imaginary—the realm of sleep and dreams.
There it does not astonish us that Langland
should meet and talk with the theological virtues,
and that very avoirdupois knights, monks, abbots,
friars, and ploughmen should be found in
company with such questionable characters as Do-well,
Do-better, Do-best, Conscience, Nature, Clergy,
and Activa Vita. He has divided his poem into
twenty “steps,” as he calls them, in each of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
he falls asleep, has a dream, and wakes up when it
becomes convenient or he is at a loss what else to
do. Meanwhile his real characters are so very real,
and his allegorical ones mingle with them on such
a common ground of easy familiarity, that we forget
the allegory altogether. We are not surprised
to find those Utopian edifices, the Tower of Truth
and the Church of Unity, in the same street with
an alehouse as genuine as that of Tam o’ Shanter,
and it would seem nothing out of the common if
we should see the twelve signs of the Zodiac saving
themselves from Deucalion’s flood in an arc of the
Ecliptic.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell here read long extracts from the
poem, with a commentary of his own, generally
brief, of which we can give only the following
fine passage on Personification.</p>

<p>The truth is, that ideal personifications are commonly
little better than pinchbeck substitutes for
imagination. They are a refuge which unimaginative
minds seek from their own sterile imaginativeness.
They stand in the same relation to poetry as
wax figures to sculpture. The more nearly they
counterfeit reality, the more unpleasant they are,
and there is always a dejected irresponsibleness
about the legs and a Brattle street air in the boots
that is ludicrous. The imagination gives us no pictures,
but the thing itself. It goes out for the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
to dwell in and inform with its own life the
object of its vision—as Keats says somewhere
in one of his letters, “I hop about the gravel and
pick up crumbs in the sparrows.” And so, in personifying,
the imagination must have energy to
project its own emotion so as to see it objectively—just
as the disease of the hypochondriac runs before
him in a black dog. Thus it was that the early
poets, “who believed the wonders that they sang,”
peopled the forests, floods, and mountains with
real shapes of beauty or terror; and accordingly in
primitive times <i>ecstasy</i> is always attributed to the
condition of the poetic mind. To the great poets
these ecstasies are still possible, and personification
had its origin in the tradition of these, and the endeavor
of inferior minds to atone for their own
languor by what we may call historical or reminiscental
imagination. Here is indicated the decline
from faith to ritual. Shakspeare has illustrated
the true secret of imaginative personification when
he makes the conscience of Macbeth become external
and visible to him in the ghastly shape at
the banquet which he alone can see, and Lady Macbeth’s
afterwards in the blood-stain on her hand.
This is the personification of the creative mind
whose thoughts are not images, but <i>things</i>. And
this seems to have been the normal condition of
Shakspeare’s genius, as it is the exceptional one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
all other poets. He alone has embodied in flesh and
blood his every thought and fancy and emotion,
his every passion and temptation. Beside him all
other poets seem but the painters and not the
makers of men. He sent out his profound intellect
to look at life from every point of view, and through
the eyes of all men and women from the highest to
the lowest. In every one he seems to have tapped
it with the knuckles, to have said sadly, <i>Tinnit, inane
est</i>, It rings, it is hollow; and then to have gone
down quietly to wait for death and another world
at Stratford.</p>

<p>As fine an example as any of the prose imagination,
of the intellect acting pictorially, is where
Hobbes compares the Papacy to the ghost of the
Roman Empire sitting upon its tomb. This implies
a foregone personification, but the pleasure it gives
springs chiefly from our sense of its historic and
intellectual truth. And this subordinate form of
imagination uses typically and metaphorically those
forms in which ecstasy had formerly visibly clothed
itself, flesh-and-blooded itself, so to speak; as where
Lord Bacon says that Persecution in the name of
Religion is “to bring down the Holy Ghost, not in
the likeness of a dove, but in the shape of a vulture
or a raven.”</p>

<p>After reading more extracts from the poem, Mr.
Lowell concluded his lecture in these words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Truly it seems to me that I can feel a heart beat
all through this old poem, a manly, trustful, and
tender one. There are some men who have what
may be called a vindictive love of Truth—whose
love of it, indeed, seems to be only another form of
hatred to their neighbor. They put crooked pins
on the stool of repentance before they invite the
erring to sit down on it. Our brother Langland is
plainly not one of these.</p>

<p>What I especially find to our purpose in Piers
Ploughman, as I said before, is that it defines
with tolerable exactness those impulses which our
poetry has received from the Anglo-Saxon as
distinguished from the Anglo-Norman element of
our race. It is a common Yankee proverb that
there is a great deal of human nature in man. I
think it especially true of the Anglo-Saxon man.
We find in this poem common sense, tenderness, a
love of spiritual goodness without much sensibility
to the merely beautiful, a kind of <i>domestic</i> feeling
of nature and a respect for what is established. But
what is still more noticeable is that man is recognized
as man, and that the conservatism of Langland
is predicated upon the well-being of the people.</p>

<p>It is impossible to revive a dead poem, but it is
pleasant, at least, to throw a memorial flower upon
its grave.</p>

</div>


<p>Where is the Golden Age? It is fifty years
ago to every man and woman of three-score
and ten. I do not doubt that aged Adam babbled of
the superiority of the good old times, and, forgetful
in his enthusiasm of that fatal bite which set the
teeth of all his descendants on edge, told, with a regretful
sigh, how much larger and finer the apples of
his youth were than that to which the great-grandson
on his knee was giving a preliminary polish.
Meanwhile the great-grandson sees the good times
far in front, a galaxy of golden pippins whereof he
shall pluck and eat as many as he likes without
question. Thus it is that none of us knows when
Time is with him, but the old man sees only his
shoulders and that inexorable wallet in which youth
and beauty and strength are borne away as alms for
Oblivion; and the boy beholds but the glowing face
and the hands stretched out full of gifts like those
of a St. Nicholas. Thus there is never any present
good; but the juggler, Life, smilingly baffles us all,
making us believe that the vanished ring is under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
his left hand or his right, the past or the future,
and shows us at last that it was in our own pocket
all the while.</p>

<p>So we may always listen with composure when
we hear of Golden Ages passed away. Burke pronounced
the funeral oration of one—of the age of
Chivalry—the period of Metrical Romances—of
which I propose to speak to-night. Mr. Ruskin—himself
as true a knight-errant as ever sat in a
demipique saddle, ready to break a lance with all
comers, and resolved that even the windmills and
the drovers shall not go about their business till
they have done homage to his Dulcinea—for the
time being joins in the lament. Nay, what do
we learn from the old romances themselves, but
that all the heroes were already dead and buried?
Their song also is a threnody, if we listen rightly.
For when did Oliver and Roland live? When
Arthur and Tristem and Lancelot and Caradoc
Break-arm? In that Golden Age of Chivalry
which is always past.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there was a great deal in the institution
of Chivalry that was picturesque; but it is
noticeable in countries where society is still picturesque
that dirt and ignorance and tyranny have the
chief hand in making them so. Mr. Fenimore
Cooper thought the American savage picturesque,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
but if he had lived in a time when it was necessary
that one should take out a policy of insurance
on his scalp or wig before going to bed, he might
have seen them in a different light. The tourist
looks up with delight at the eagle sliding in smooth-winged
circles on the icy mountain air, and sparkling
back the low morning sun like a belated star.
But what does the lamb think of him? Let us
look at Chivalry a moment from the lamb’s point
of view.</p>

<p>It is true that the investiture of the Knight was
a religious ceremony, but this was due to the
Church, which in an age of brute force always
maintained the traditions at least of the intellect
and conscience. The vows which the Knights took
had as little force as those of god-parents, who fulfil
their spiritual relation by sending a piece of plate
to the god-child. They stood by each other when
it was for their interest to do so, but the only virtue
they had any respect for was an arm stronger than
their own. It is hard to say which they preferred
to break—a head, or one of the Ten Commandments.
They looked upon the rich Jew with thirty-two
sound teeth in his head as a providential contrivance,
and practised upon him a comprehensive
kind of dental surgery, at once for profit and
amusement, and then put into some chapel a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
painted window with a Jewish prophet in it for piety—as
if <i>they</i> were the Jewish profits they cared
about. They outraged and robbed their vassals in
every conceivable manner, and, if <i>very</i> religious,
made restitution on their death-beds by giving a
part of the plunder (when they could keep it no
longer) to have masses sung for the health of their
souls—thus contriving, as they thought, to be their
own heirs in the other world. Individual examples
of heroism are not wanting to show that man is always
paramount to the institutions of his own contriving,
so that any institution will yield itself to
the compelling charms of a noble nature. But even
were this not so, yet Sir Philip Sidney, the standard
type of the chivalrous, grew up under other influences.
So did Lord Herbert of Cherbury, so did
the incomparable Bayard; and the single fact that
is related as a wonderful thing of Bayard, that, after
the storming of Brescia, he respected the honor of
the daughter of a lady in whose house he was quartered,
notwithstanding she was beautiful and in his
power, is of more weight than all the romances in
Don Quixote’s library.</p>

<p>But what form is that which rises before us, with
features in which the gentle and forgiving reproach
of the woman is lost in the aspiring power of the
martyr?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p><i>We</i> know her as she was,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The whitest lily in the shield of France,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With heart of virgin gold,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>that bravest and most loyal heart over whose beatings
knightly armor was ever buckled, that saintly
shape in which even battle looks lovely, that life so
pure, so inspired, so humble, which stands there
forever to show us how near womanhood ever is to
heroism, and that the human heart is true to an eternal
instinct when it paints Faith and Hope and Charity
and Religion with the countenances of women.</p>

<p>We are told that the sentiment of respect for
woman, a sentiment always remarkable in the Teutonic
race, is an inheritance from the Institution of
Chivalry. But womanhood must be dressed in silk
and miniver that chivalry may recognize it. That
priceless pearl hidden in the coarse kirtle of the
peasant-girl of Domremy it trampled under its
knightly feet—shall I say?—or swinish hoofs.
Poor Joan! The chivalry of France sold her; the
chivalry of England subjected her to outrages
whose burning shame cooled the martyr-fire, and
the King whom she had saved, the very top of
French Knighthood, was toying with Agnes Sorel
while the fagots were crackling around the savior
of himself and his kingdom in the square of Rouen!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Thank God, that our unchivalric generation can
hack the golden spurs from such recreant heels!
A statue stands now where her ashes were gathered
to be cast into the Seine, but her fittest monument
is the little fountain beneath it, the emblem of
her innocence, of her inspiration, drawn not from
court, or castle, or cloister, but from the inscrutable
depths of that old human nature and that
heaven common to us all—an emblem, no less,
that the memory of a devoted life is a spring where
all coming times may drink the holy waters of
gratitude and aspiration. I confess that I cannot
see clearly that later scaffold in the Place de la
Révolution, through the smoke of this martyr-fire
at Rouen, but it seems to me that, compared with
this <i>woman</i>, the Marie Antoinette, for whose sake
Burke lamented the downfall of chivalry, is only
the daughter of a king.</p>

<p>But those old days, whether good or bad, have
left behind them a great body of literature, of which
even yet a large part remains unprinted. To this
literature belong the Metrical Romances. Astonished
by the fancy and invention so abundantly
displayed by the writers of these poems, those who
have written upon the subject have set themselves
gravely to work to find out what country they could
have got them from. Mr. Warton, following Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Warburton, inclines to assign them to an Oriental
origin. Dr. Percy, on the other hand, asserts a
Scandinavian origin; while Ritson, who would have
found it reason enough to think that the sun rose
in the West if Warton or Percy had taken the other
side, is positive that they were wholly French.
Perhaps the truth lies somewhere between the positions
of Percy and Ritson. The Norman race,
neither French nor Scandinavian, was a product of
the mingled blood of both, and in its mental characteristics
we find the gaiety and lively fancy of
the one tempering what is wild in the energy and
gloomy in the imagination of the other.</p>

<p>We know the exact date of the arrival of the
first Metrical Romance in England. Taillefer, a
Norman minstrel, brought it over in his head, and
rode in the front at the battle of Hastings singing
the song of Roland. Taillefer answers precisely
the description of a Danish skald, but he sang in
French, and the hero he celebrated was one of the
peers of Charlemagne, who was himself a German.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Taillefer, who well could sing a strain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a swift horse rode amain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the Duke and chanted loud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Charlemagne and Roland good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Oliver and vassals brave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who found at Roncesvalles their grave.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>
<p>What this song of Roland was it is impossible
to say, as the only copy of it seems to have perished
with Taillefer at the battle of Hastings; but
it was probably of the same kind with many of
those which have survived and brought down to
us the exploits of Arthur and his knights.</p>

<p>With regard to a large part of the romances of
the Round Table, and those which grew out of
them, it is tolerably certain that, although written
in French, they were made in England.</p>

<p>One of the great charms of the Metrical Romances
is the innocent simplicity with which they commit
anachronisms. Perhaps it would be more exact to
call them synchronisms, for, with the most undoubting
faith, they compel all other times to adopt the
dress, manners, and conventionalities of their own.
To them there was no one world, nor ever had been
any, except that of Romance. They conferred retrospective
knighthood upon the patriarchs; upon
Job, David, and Solomon. Joseph of Arimathea
became Sir Joseph of that ilk. Even the soldier
who pierced the side of Jesus upon the cross was
made into Sir Longinus and represented as running
a tilt with our Lord. All the heroes of the Grecian
legend were treated in the same way. They translated
the old time and the old faith into new, and
thus completed the outfit of their own imaginary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
world, supplying it at a very cheap rate with a Past
and with mythology. And as they believed the
gods and genii of the Pagan ancients to have been
evil spirits who, though undeified, were imperishable
in their essence, they were allowed to emigrate
in a body from the old religion into the new, where
they continued to exercise their functions, sometimes
under their former names, but oftener in some
disguise. These unfortunate aliens seem to have
lived very much from hand to mouth, and after the
invention of holy water (more terrible to them than
Greek-fire) they must have had rather an uncomfortable
time of it. The giants were received with
enthusiasm, and admitted to rights of citizenship
in the land of Romance, where they were allowed
to hold fiefs and castles in consideration of their
eminent usefulness in abducting damsels, and their
serving as anvils to the knights, who sometimes belabored
them for three days at a time, the fight ending
at last, not from failure of breath on the part
of the combatants but of the minstrel. As soon as
<i>he</i> has enough, or sees that his hearers have, the head
of the unhappy giant becomes loose on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Another charm of the romances is their entire
inconsequentiality. As soon as we enter this wonderful
country the old fetters of cause and effect
drop from our limbs, and we are no longer bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
to give a reason for anything. All things come to
pass in that most charming of ways which children
explain by the comprehensive metaphysical formula—“<i>’cause</i>.”
Nothing seems to be premeditated,
but a knight falls in love, or out of it, fights, goes
on board enchanted vessels that carry him to countries
laid down on no chart, and all without asking
a question. In truth, it is a delightful kind of impromptu
life, such as we all should like to lead if we
could, with nothing set down in the bills beforehand.</p>

<p>But the most singular peculiarity of Romance-land
remains to be noticed—there are no <i>people</i> in
it, that is, no common people. The lowest rank in
life is that of a dwarf. It is true that if a knight
loses his way there will always be a clown or two
to set him right. But they disappear at once, and
seem to be wholly phantasmagoric, or, at best, an expedient
rendered necessary by the absence of guide-posts,
and the inability of the cavaliers to read them
if there had been any. There are plenty of Saracens
no doubt, but they are more like cucumbers
than men, and are introduced merely that the knight
may have the pleasure of slicing them.</p>

<p>We cannot claim any condensed poetical merit
for the Metrical Romances. They have very few
quotable passages and fewer vigorous single lines.
Their merit consists in a diffuse picturesqueness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
reading them is like turning over illuminated missals
in a traveler’s half-hour, which leave a vague
impression on the mind of something vivid and
fanciful, without one’s being able to recall any particular
beauty. Some of them have great narrative
merit, being straightforward and to the purpose,
never entangling themselves in reflection or subordinating
the story to the expression. In this respect
they are refreshing after reading many poems
of the modern school, which, under the pretense of
sensuousness, are truly sensual, and deal quite as
much with the upholstery as with the soul of poetry.
The thought has nowadays become of less importance
than the vehicle of it, and amid the pomp of
words we are too often reminded of an Egyptian
procession, in which all the painful musical instruments
then invented, priests, soldiers, and royalty
itself, accompany the triumphal chariot containing
perhaps, after all, only an embalmed monkey or a
pickled ibis.</p>

<p>There is none of this nonsense in the Old Romances,
though sometimes they are tediously sentimental,
and we wonder as much at the capacity of
our ancestors in bearing dry verses as dry blows.
Generally, however, they show an unaffected piety
and love of nature. The delight of the old minstrels
in the return of Spring is particularly agreeable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and another argument in favor of the Northern
origin of this class of poems. Many of them open
with passages like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Merry it is in the month of May,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the small fowls sing their lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then flowers the apple-tree and perry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the little birds sing merry;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the ladies strew their bowers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With red roses and lily flowers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The damisels lead down the dance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the knights play with shield and lance.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some of the comparisons, also, drawn from Nature,
are as fresh as dew. For example, when a
lady sees her lover:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She is as glad at that sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the birds are of the light.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As glad as grass is of the rain.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A knight is said to be</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As weary as water in a weir,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>a simile full of imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>The most airy glimpses of the picturesque occur
sometimes; as describing a troop of knights:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They rode away full serriedly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their gilded pennons of silk of Ind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Merrily rattled with the wind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The steeds so noble and so wight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leaped and neighed beneath each knight.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After quoting various specimens of these poems,
Mr. Lowell gave the following sketch of the manners
and customs of Romance-land, “condensed
from the best authorities.”</p>

<p>If you are born in this remarkable country and
destined for a hero, the chances are that by the
time you are seven years old your father will have
gone off to fight the infidels, and a neighboring
earl will have taken possession of his estates and
his too-hastily-supposed widow. You resent this
in various ways, especially by calling your step-father
all the proper names you can think of that
are improper. He, for some unexplained reason, is
unable to get rid of you, though he tries a variety
of plots level with the meanest capacity. You, being
of uncommon sagacity, are saved by the aid of
three or four superfluous miracles. Meanwhile you
contrive to pick up a good knightly education, and
by the time you are seventeen are bigger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
stronger and handsomer than anybody else, except,
of course, the giants. So, one day you buckle
on your armor, mount your horse, who is as remarkable
in his way as yourself, and go adventuring.
Presently you come to a castle where you
are most courteously received. Maidens as white
as whale’s bone and fair as flowers (they are all so
in Romance-land) help you off with your armor,
and dress you in richest silks. You then go to
dine with the Lord of the Castle, who is a knight
of very affable manners and agreeable conversation,
but with an aversion to religious topics. His
daughter, the fairest lady on the ground, assists at
the meal. You are conducted to your chamber,
and after a refreshing sleep meet your host and
hostess at breakfast. At a suitable time you return
thanks for your kind treatment and ask for
your horse. The knight, however, in the blandest
manner tells you that a little custom of his will interfere
with your departure. He is in the habit of
fighting with all his guests, and has hitherto been
successful in killing them all to the number of
several hundred. This is precisely the account
which you are fond of settling, and after a few
allusions to Mahomed and Termagant and Alcoban,
you accept the challenge and, of course, come off
victor. This seems to settle the matter for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
young lady whom your lance has just promoted to
her inheritance, and she immediately offers herself
and her estates to you, telling you, at the same
time, that she had long been secretly a Christian.
Though madly in love with her, and interested in
her religious views, which she details to you at
some length, you mount your steed and ride away,
but without being expected to give any reasons.
You have a particular mission nowhere, and on
your way to that interesting country you kill a
<i>megalosaurus</i> (for whose skeleton Professor Owen
would have given his ears), and two or three incidental
giants. Riding on, you come to a Paynim-land,
ruled over by a liberally-minded Soldan, who
receives you into favor after you have slain some
thousands of his subjects to get an appetite for
dinner. The Soldan, of course, has a daughter,
who is converted by you, and, of course, offers you
her hand. This makes you think of the other lady,
and you diplomatize. But there is another Paynim-land,
and another Soldan, who sends word that he
intends to marry your beautiful convert.</p>

<p>The embassy of the proud Paynim somehow results
in your being imprisoned for seven years,
when it suddenly occurs to you that you might
as well step out. So you pick up a magic sword
that has been shut up with you, knock down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
jailers, mount your horse which is waiting at the
door, and ride off. Now, or at some other convenient
time, you take occasion to go mad for a year
or two on account of ladye-love number one. But
hearing that ladye-love number two is about to
yield to the addresses of her royal suitor, who has
killed her father, burned his capital, and put all his
subjects to the sword, you make some appropriate
theological disquisitions and start to the rescue.
On your way you meet a strange knight, join combat
with him without any questions on either side,
and after a doubtful fight of a day or two, are mutually
overcome with amazement at finding anybody
who cannot be beaten. Of course it turns out that
the strange knight is your father; you join forces,
make short work with the amorous Soldan and his
giants, and find yourself encumbered with a young
lady, a princess too, all of whose relatives and vassals
have been slaughtered on your account, and
who naturally expects you to share her throne. In
a moment of abstraction you consent to the arrangement,
and are married by an archbishop <i>in
partibus</i> who happens to be on the spot. As your
late royal rival has slain all your late father-in-law’s
lieges, and you have done the same service for him
in turn, there are no adventures left in this part
of the world. Luckily, before the wedding-ring is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
warm on your finger, a <i>plesiosaurus</i> turns up. This
saves many disagreeable explanations with the
bride, whom you are resolved to have nothing to
do with while the other young lady is alive. You
settle her comfortably on the throne of her depopulated
kingdom, slay the monster, and start for home
with your revered parent. There you overcome
the usurping Earl, reinstate your father, and assist
cheerfully at the burning of your mother for bigamy;
your filial piety being less strong than your
reverence for the laws of your country. A fairy
who has a particular interest in you (and who, it
seems, is your real mother, after all—a fact which
relieves your mind of any regrets on the score of
the late melancholy bonfire), lets you into the secret
that ladye-love the first is your own sister. This
revives your affection for your wife, and you go
back to the kingdom of Gombraunt, find her reduced
to extremities by another matrimonial Soldan,
whom you incontinently massacre with all <i>his</i>
giants, and now at last a prospect of quiet domestic
life seems to open. Dull, peaceful days follow, and
you begin to take desponding views of life, when
your <i>ennui</i> is pleasantly broken in upon by a monster

<p>One of the laws of the historical Macbeth declares
that “Fools, minstrels, bards, and all
other such idle people, unless they be specially
licensed by the King, shall be compelled to seek
some craft to win their living,” and the old chronicler
adds approvingly, “These and such-like laws
were used by King Macbeth, through which he
governed the realm ten years in good justice.”</p>

<p>I do not quote this in order to blacken the memory
of that unhappy monarch. The poets commonly
contrive to be even with their enemies in
the end, and Shakspeare has taken an ample revenge.
I cite it only for the phrase <i>unless they be
specially licensed by the King</i>, which points to a
fact on which I propose to dwell for a few moments
before entering upon my more immediate
object.</p>

<p>When Virgil said, “Arma virumque cano,” “Arms
and the man I sing,” he defined in the strictest manner
the original office of the poet, and the object of
the judicious Macbeth’s ordinance was to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
any one from singing the wrong arms and the rival
man. Formerly the poet held a recognized place
in the body politic, and if he has been deposed
from it, it may be some consolation to think that
the <i>Fools</i>, whom the Scottish usurper included in
his penal statute, have not lost their share in the
government of the world yet, nor, if we may trust
appearances, are likely to for some time to come.
But the Fools here referred to were not those who
had least, but those who had most wit, and who
assumed that disguise in order to take away any
dangerous appearance of intention from their jibes
and satires.</p>

<p>The poet was once what the political newspaper
is now, and circulated from ear to ear with satire
or panegyric. He it was who first made public
opinion a power in the State by condensing it
into a song. The invention of printing, by weakening
the faculty of memory, and by transferring
the address of language from the ear to the eye,
has lessened the immediate power of the poet. A
newspaper may be suppressed, an editor may be
silenced, every copy of an obnoxious book may be
destroyed, but in those old days when the minstrels
were a power, a verse could wander safely from
heart to heart and from hamlet to hamlet as unassailable
as the memories on which it was imprinted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Its force was in its impersonality, for public opinion
is disenchanted the moment it is individualized, and
is terrible only so long as it is the opinion of no one
in particular. Find its author, and the huge shadow
which but now darkened half the heaven shrinks
like the genius of the Arabian story into the compass
of a leaden casket which one can hold in his
hand. Nowadays one knows the editor, perhaps,
and so is on friendly terms with public opinion.
You may have dined with it yesterday, rubbed
shoulders with it in the omnibus to-day, nay, carried
it in your pocket embodied in the letter of the
special correspondent.</p>

<p>Spenser, in his prose tract upon Ireland, has left
perhaps the best description possible of the primitive
poet as he was everywhere when the copies of
a poem were so many living men, and all publication
was to the accompaniment of music. He says:
“There is amongst the Irish a certain kind of
people called bards, which are to them instead of
poets, whose profession is to set forth the praises
or dispraises of men in their poems or rhythms;
the which are held in such high regard or esteem
amongst them that none dare to displease them for
fear of running into reproach through this offense,
and to be made infamous in the mouths of all men.”</p>

<p>Nor was the sphere of the bards confined to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
present alone. They were also the embodied memory
of the people. It was on the wings of verse that
the names of ancestral heroes could float down securely
over broad tracts of desert time and across
the gulfs of oblivion. And poets were sometimes
made use of by sagacious rulers to make legends
serve a political purpose. The Persian poet Firdusi
is a remarkable instance of this. Virgil also attempted
to braid together the raveled ends of Roman
and Greek tradition, and it is not impossible
that the minstrels of the Norman metrical romances
were guided by a similar instinct.</p>

<p>But the position of the inhabitants of England
was a peculiar one. The Saxons by their conversion
to Christianity, and the Normans still more by
their conversion and change of language, were almost
wholly cut off from the past. The few fragments
of the Celtic race were the only natives of
Britain who had an antiquity. The English properly
so called were a people who hardly knew their own
grandfathers. They no longer spoke the language,
believed in the religion, or were dominated by the
ideas of their ancestors.</p>

<p>English writers demand of us a national literature.
But where for thirteen centuries was their
own? Our ancestors brought a past with them to
Plymouth; they claimed descent from a great race;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
the language they spoke had been ennobled by recording
the triumphs of ancestral daring and genius;
it had gone up to Heaven wafted on the red wings
of martyr-fires; mothers hushed their new-born
babes, and priests scattered the farewell earth upon
the coffin-lid, with words made sweet or sacred by
immemorial association. But the Normans when
they landed in England were a new race of armed
men almost as much cut off from the influences of
the past as those which sprang out of the ground
at the sowing of the dragon’s teeth. They found
there a Saxon encampment occupying a country
strange to them also. For we must remember
that though Britain was historically old, England
was not; and it was as impossible to piece the
histories of the two together to make a national
record of as it would be for us to persuade ourselves
into a feeling of continental antiquity by
adopting the Mexican annals.</p>

<p>The ballads are the first truly national poetry in
our language, and national poetry is not either that
of the drawing-room or of the kitchen. It is the
common mother-earth of the universal sentiment
that the foot of the poet must touch, through
which shall steal up to heart and brain that fine
virtue which puts him in sympathy, not with his
class, but with his kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately for the ballad-makers, they were not
encumbered with any useless information. They
had not wit enough to lose their way. It is only
the greatest brains and the most intense imagination
that can fuse learning into one substance with
their own thought and feeling, and so interpenetrate
it with <i>themselves</i> that the acquired is as much
<i>they</i> as the native. The ballad-makers had not far
to seek for material. The shipwreck, the runaway
match, the unhappy marriage, the village ghost, the
achievement of the border outlaw—in short, what
we read every day under the head of <i>Items</i> in the
newspapers, were the inspiration of their song.
And they sang well, because they thought, and felt,
and believed just as their hearers did, and because
they never thought anything about it. The ballads
are pathetic because the poet did not try to make
them so; and they are models of nervous and simple
diction because the business of the poet was to <i>tell</i>
his story, and not to adorn it; and accordingly he
went earnestly and straightforwardly to work, and
let the rapid thought snatch the word as it ran,
feeling quite sure of its getting the right one. The
only art of expression is to have something to express.
We feel as wide a difference between what
is manufactured and what is spontaneous as between
the sparkles of an electrical machine, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
a sufficiently muscular professor can grind out by
the dozen, and the wildfire of God that writes
<i>mene, mene</i>, on the crumbling palace walls of midnight
cloud.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the ballad-maker, in respect
of diction, had also this advantage—that he had no
books. Language, when it speaks to the eye only,
loses half its meaning. For the eye is an outpost
of the brain, and wears its livery oftener than that
of the character. But the temperament, the deep
human nature, the aboriginal emotions, <i>these</i> utter
themselves in the voice. It is only by the ear that
the true mother-tongue that knows the short way
to the heart is learned. I do not believe that a man
born deaf could understand Shakspeare, or sound
anything but the edges and shores of Lear’s tempestuous
woe. I think that the great masters of
speech have hunted men and not libraries, and
have found the secret of their power in the street
and not upon the shelf.</p>

<p>It is the <i>way</i> of saying things that is learned by
commerce with men, and the best writers have
mixed much with the world. It is there only that
the language of feeling can be acquired.</p>

<p>The ballads are models of narrative poetry.
They are not concerned with the utterance of
thought, but only of sentiment or passion, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
as illustrating poetic diction that I shall chiefly cite
them. If they moralize it is always by picture, and
not by preachment. What discourse of inconstancy
has the force and biting pathos of this grim old
song, the “Twa Corbies”?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As I was walking all alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I heard twa corbies making a moan.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The one unto the other did say:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where shall we gang and dine to-day?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In beyond that old turf dyke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I wot there lies a new-slain knight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And naebody kens that he lies there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But his hawk and his hound and his lady fair.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hound is to the hunting gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His hawk to fetch the wild-fowl hame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His lady’s ta’en anither mate—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sae we may make our dinner sweet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’ll sit upon his white neck-bone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’ll pick out his bonny blue een;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a lock of his golden hair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll thatch our nest when it grows bare.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many a one for him makes moan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But none sall ken where he is gone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er his white bones when they grow bare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wind shall blow forever mair.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Observe, the wind simply blows. That is enough;
but a modern poet would have sought to intensify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
by making the wind moan, or shriek, or sob, or
something of the kind.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell here quoted a ballad which tells a
story of a child-murder. It begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fair Anne sate in her bower</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Down by the greenwood side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the flowers did spring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the birds did sing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Twas the pleasant Mayday tide.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ballad singers had all the advantage of that
spur of the moment which the excitement of speaking
gives, and they also received the magnetism
which came from the sympathy of their hearers.
They knew what <i>told</i>, for they had their hand upon
the living pulse of feeling. There was no time to
palaver; they must come to the point.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Percy came out of Northumberland,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And a vow to God made he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That he would hunt in the mountains</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of Cheviot within days three,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the maugre of Doughty Douglas</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And all that ever with him be.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They plunge into deep water at once. And there
is never any filling up. The transitions are abrupt.
You can no more foretell the swift wheel of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
feeling than that of a falcon, and the phrases flash
forth sharp-edged and deadly like a sword drawn
in wrath. The passions speak out savagely and
without any delicacies of circumlocution.</p>

<p>It is worth thinking of whether the press, which
we have a habit of calling such a fine institution,
be not weakening the fibre and damaging the sincerity
of our English and our thinking, quite as
fast as it diffuses intelligence.</p>

<p>Consider the meaning of expression—something
wrung from us by the grip of thought or passion,
whether we will or no. But the editor is quite as
often compelled to write that he may fill an empty
column as that he may relieve an overfilled brain.
And in a country like ours, where newspapers are
the only reading of the mass of the people, there is a
danger of a general contentedness in commonplace.
For we always become what we habitually read.
We let our newspapers think for us, argue for us,
criticize for us, remember for us, do everything for
us, in short, that will save us from the misfortune of
being <i>ourselves</i>. And so, instead of men and women,
we find ourselves in a world inhabited by incarnated
leaders, or paragraphs, or items of this or
that journal. We are apt to wonder at the scholarship
of the men of two centuries ago. They were
scholars because they did not read so much as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
do. We spend more time over print than they did,
but instead of communing with the choice thought
of choice spirits, and insensibly acquiring the grand
manner of that supreme society, we diligently inform
ourselves of such facts as that a fine horse
belonging to Mr. Smith ran away on Wednesday
and that a son of Mr. Brown fell into the canal on
Thursday, or that a gravel bank fell in and buried
Patrick O’Callahan on Friday. And it is our own
fault, and not that of the editor. For <i>we</i> make the
newspapers, and the editor would be glad to give us
better stuff if we did not <i>demand</i> such as this.</p>

<p>Another evil of this state of things is the watering,
or milk-and-watering, of our English. Writing
to which there is no higher compelling destiny than
the coming of the printer’s devil must end in this
at last. The paragraphist must make his paragraph,
and the longer he makes it, the better for him and
the worse for us. The virtue of words becomes
wholly a matter of length. Accordingly, we have
now no longer any fires, but “disastrous conflagrations”;
nobody dies, but “deceases” or “demises”;
men do not fall from houses, but are “precipitated
from mansions or edifices”; a convict is not hanged,
but “suffers the extreme penalty of the offended
law,” etc.</p>

<p>The old ballad-makers lived in a better day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
They did not hear of so many events that none of
them made any impression. They did not live, as
we do, in a world that seems a great ear of Dionysius,
where if a scandal is whispered in Pekin we
hear of it in New York. The minstrels had no
metaphysical bees in their bonnets. They did not
speculate about this world or the next. They had
not made the great modern discovery that a bird in
a bush is worth two in the hand. They did not
analyze and refine till nothing genuine was left of
this beautiful world but an indigestion.</p>

<p>The ballads neither harangue nor describe; but
only state things in the least complex way. Those
old singers caught language fresh and with a flavor
of the soil in it still, and their hearers were people
of healthy sensibilities who must be hit directly
and hard. Accordingly, there is a very vigorous
handling. They speak bluntly and to the purpose.
If a maiden loses her lover, she merely</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Turns her face unto the wall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there her heart it breaks.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A modern poet would have hardly thrown away
the opportunity offered him for describing the
chamber and its furniture; he would put a painted
window into it—for the inkstand will supply them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
quite as cheaply as plain glass. He would tell you
all about the tapestry which the eyes of the dying
maiden in her extreme agony would have been
likely, of course, to have been minutely interested
in. He would have given a clinical lecture on the
symptoms, and a post-mortem examination. It
was so lucky for those old ballad-mongers that they
had not any ideas! And when they give a dying
speech they do not make their heroes take leave of
the universe in general as if <i>that</i> were going into
mourning for a death more or less.</p>

<p>When Earl Douglas is in his death-thraw, he
says to his nephew:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My wound is deep; I fain would sleep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Take thou the vanguard of the three.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hide me by the brakenbush</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That grows on yonder lily lee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O bury me by the brakenbush</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Beneath the blooming brere.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let never living mortal ken</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That a kindly Scot lies here.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ballads are the only true folk-songs that we
have in English. There is no other poetry in the
language that addresses us so simply as mere men
and women. Learning has tempered with modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
poetry, and the Muse, like Portia, wears a doctor’s
cap and gown.</p>

<p>The force and earnestness of style that mark the
old ballad become very striking when contrasted
with later attempts in the same way. It is not
flatness and insipidity that they are remarkable
for, but for a bare rocky grandeur in whose crevices
tenderness nestles its chance tufts of ferns and
harebells. One of these sincere old verses imbedded
in the insipidities of a modern imitation looks out
stern and colossal as that charcoal head which
Michael Angelo drew on the wall of the Farnesina
glowers through the paling frescoes.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell here read a number of passages from
the old ballad entitled “Margaret’s Ghost,” and
compared them with a few stanzas from an “improved”
version of the same by Mallet. He also
read from the ballad of “Helen of Kirkconnell,” and
from others.</p>

<p>Of the tenderness of the ballads I must give an
instance or two before I leave them. In the old
ballad of “Clerk Saunders,” Margaret follows the
ghost of her lover to his grave.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So painfully she climbed the wall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She climbed the wall up after him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hose nor shoon upon her feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She had no time to put them on.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O bonny, bonny, sang the bird</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sat on a coil o’ hay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But mournfu’, mournfu’, was the maid</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That followed the corpse o’ clay.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Is there any room at your head, Saunders?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or any room at your feet?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is there any room at your side, Saunders?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For fain, fain I would sleep.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She’s sat her down upon the grave</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And mourned sae lang and sair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the clochs and wanton flies at last</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Came and built in her yellow hair.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In further illustration Mr. Lowell read from the
“Clerk’s Two Sons of Oxenford.” He concluded his
lecture thus:</p>

<p>I think that the makers of the old ballads did
stand face to face with life in a way that is getting
more and more impossible for us. Day by day the
art of printing isolates us more and more from our
fellows and from the healthy and inspiring touch
of our fellows. We continually learn more and
more of mankind and less of man. We know more
of Europe than of our own village. We feel humanity
from afar.</p>

<p>But I must not forget that the ballads have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
passed through a sieve which no modern author
has the advantage of. Only those have come down
to us which imprinted themselves on the general
heart. The new editions were struck off by mothers
crooning their children to sleep, or by wandering
minstrels who went about sowing the seeds of
courtesy and valor in the cottage and on the hillside.
Print, which, like the amber, preserves all an
author’s grubs, gives men the chance to try him by
the average, rather than the best, of his yield.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Review of the ballad-singer was in
the faces of his ring of hearers, in whose glow or
chill he could read at a glance a criticism from
which there was no appeal. It was not Smith or
Brown, but the human heart that judged him.</p>

<p>Doubtless another advantage of these old poets
was their out-of-door life. They went from audience
to audience on foot, and had no more cramped
a study than the arch of heaven, no library but
clouds, streams, mountains, woods, and men. There
is something more in sunshine than mere light and
heat. I fancy that a kind of flavor we detect in
the old ballads is due to it, and that it may give
color and bloom to the brain as well as to the apple
and plum. Indoor inspiration is like the stove-heat
of the forcing-house, and the fruits ripened by it
are pale, dropsical, and wanting in <i>tang</i>. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
may be also a virtue in the fireside which gives to
the Northern wind a domestic and family warmth,
and makes it skilled to teach the ethics of home.
But it is not to the chimney-corner that we can
trace the spiritual dynasties that have swayed mankind.
These have sunshine in their veins.</p>

<p>Perhaps another charm of these ballads is that nobody
made them. They seem to have come up like
violets, and we have only to thank God for them.
And we imply a sort of fondness when we call
them “old.” It is an epithet we give endearingly
and not as supposing any decrepitude or senescence
in them. Like all true poetry, they are not only
young themselves, but the renewers of youth in
us; they do not lose, but accumulate, strength and
life. A true poem gets a part of its inspiring force
from each generation of men. The great stream of
Homer rolls down to us out of the past, swollen
with the tributary delight and admiration of the
ages. The next generation will find Shakspeare
fuller of meaning and energy by the addition of
our enthusiasm. Sir Philip Sidney’s admiration is
part of the breath that sounds through the trumpet
of “Chevy Chase.” That is no empty gift with
which we invest a poem when we bestow on it our
own youth, and it is no small debt we owe the true
poem that it preserves for us some youth to bestow.</p>

<p>It is always a piece of good fortune to be the earliest
acknowledged poet of any country. We
prize the first poems as we do snowdrops, not only
for their own intrinsic beauty, but even more for
that force of heart and instinct of sunshine in them
which brings them up, where grass is brown and
trees are bare, the outposts and forlorn hopes of
spring. There never comes anything again like a
<i>first</i> sensation, and those who love Chaucer, though
they may have learned late to do it, cannot help
imaginatively antedating their delight, and giving
him that place in the calendar of their personal experience
which belongs to him in the order of our
poetic history.</p>

<p>And the feeling is a true one, for although intensity
be the great characteristic of all genius, and
the power of the poet is measured by his ability to
renew the charm of freshness in what is outworn
and habitual, yet there is something in Chaucer
which gives him a personal property in the epithet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
“vernal,” and makes him seem always to go hand
in hand with May.</p>

<p>In our New England especially, where Mayday
is a mere superstition and the Maypole a poor
half-hardy exotic which shivers in an east wind
almost as sharp as Endicott’s axe,—where frozen
children, in unseasonable muslin, celebrate the
floral games with nosegays from the milliner’s, and
winter reels back, like shattered Lear, bringing the
dead spring in his arms, her budding breast and
wan dilustered cheeks all overblown with the drifts
and frosty streaks of his white beard,—where even
Chanticleer, whose sap mounts earliest in that
dawn of the year, stands dumb beneath the dripping
eaves of his harem, with his melancholy tail
at half-mast,—one has only to take down a volume
of Chaucer, and forthwith he can scarce step
without crushing a daisy, and the sunshine flickers
on small new leaves that throb thick with song of
merle and mavis. A breath of spring blows out of
the opening lines of the “Canterbury Tales” that
seems to lift the hair upon our brow:</p>

</div>

<p>Even Shakspeare, who comes after everybody has
done his best and seems to say, “Here, let me take
hold a minute and show you how to do it,” could
not mend that. With Chaucer, the sun seems
never to have run that other half of his course in
the Ram, but to have stood still there and made
one long spring-day of his life.</p>

<p>Chaucer was probably born in 1328, seven years
after the death of Dante, and he certainly died in
1400, having lived consequently seventy-two years.
Of his family we know nothing. He was educated
either at Oxford or Cambridge, or at neither of
these famous universities. He was, perhaps, a student
at the Inner Temple, on the books of which
a certain phantasmagoric Mr. Buckley had read a
record that “Geoffrey Chaucer was fined two shillings
for beating a Franciscan friar in Fleet
street.”</p>

<p>In the thirty-ninth year of his age he received
from Edward III a pension of twenty marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
(equal to $1000 now), and afterwards a grant of a
pitcher of wine daily, and the custody of a ward
which gave £104 a year, and two places in the customs.
In the last year of Edward III he was one
of three envoys sent to France to negotiate a marriage
between the Prince of Wales and a daughter
of the French King. Richard II confirmed his pension
of twenty marks, and granted him another of
like amount instead of the daily wine.</p>

<p>Chaucer married Philippa Pycard or De la Roet,
sister of Katherine Swynford, the third wife of John
of Gaunt. By this connection he is supposed to
have become a favorer of Wycliffe’s doctrines, and
was in some way concerned in the insurrection of
John of Northampton, which seems to have had for
its object some religious reform. He was forced
to fly into Holland, and is said to have made his
peace at last by betraying his companions. I think
one’s historical comfort is not disturbed by refusing
to credit this story, especially as it stains the
fame of a great poet, and, if character may ever
be judged from writings, a good man. We may
grant that he broke the Franciscan friar’s head in
Fleet street, if it were only for the alliteration, but
let us doubt that he ever broke his faith. It is very
doubtful whether he was such stuff as martyrs are
made of. Plump men, though nature would seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
to have marked them as more combustible, seldom
go to the stake, but rather your lean fellows, who
can feel a fine satisfaction in not burning well to
spite the Philistines.</p>

<p>At this period of his life Chaucer is thought to
have been in straitened circumstances, but a new
pension and a yearly pipe of wine were granted
him by Richard II, and on the accession of Henry
IV these were confirmed, with a further pension
of forty marks. These he only lived a year to enjoy,
dying October 25, 1400.</p>

<p>The most poetical event in Chaucer’s life the critics
have, of course, endeavored to take away from
us. This is his meeting with Petrarch, to which he
alludes in the prologue to the Clerk’s “Tale of Griseldis.”
There is no reason for doubting this that
I am able to discover, except that it is so pleasing
to think of, and that Chaucer affirms it. Chaucer’s
embassy to Italy was in 1373, the last year of Petrarch’s
life, and it was in this very year that Petrarch
first read the “Decameron.” In his letter to
Boccaccio he says: “The touching story of Griseldis
has been ever since laid up in my memory that I
may relate it in my conversations with my friends.”
We are forced to believe so many things that ought
never to have happened that the heart ought to be
allowed to recompense itself by receiving as fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
without too close a scrutiny of the evidence, whatever
deserved to take place so truly as this did.
Reckoning back, then, by the finer astronomy of
our poetic instinct, we find that a conjunction of
these two stars of song did undoubtedly occur in
that far-off heaven of the Past.</p>

<p>On the whole, we may consider the life of Chaucer
as one of the happiest, and also the most fortunate,
that ever fell to the lot of poets. In the course of
it he must have been brought into relation with all
ranks of men. He had been a student of books, of
manners, and of countries. In his description of
the Clerk of Oxford, in which there is good ground
for thinking that he alludes to some of his own
characteristics, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>
<p>What a pleasant, companionable nature the last
verse testifies to. The portrait of Chaucer, too, is
perhaps more agreeable than that of any other
English poet. The downcast, meditative eyes, the
rich mouth, and the beautiful broad brow drooping
with the weight of thought, and yet with an eternal
youth and freshness shining out of it as from the
morning forehead of a boy, are all remarkable, and
their harmony with each other in a placid tenderness
not less so.</p>

<p>Chaucer’s beginnings as an author were translations
from the French and Italian. Imitations they
should rather be called, for he put <i>himself</i> into them,
and the mixture made a new poem. He helped
himself without scruple from every quarter. And,
indeed, there is nothing more clear than that the
great poets are not sudden prodigies, but slow results.
Just as an oak profits by the foregone lives
of immemorial vegetable races, so we may be sure
that the genius of every remembered poet drew the
forces that built it up from the decay of a whole
forest of forgotten ones. And in proportion as the
genius is vigorous and original will its indebtedness
be; will it strike its roots deeper into the past and
into remoter fields in search of the virtue that must
sustain it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Chaucer, like Shakspeare, invented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
almost nothing. Wherever he found anything directed
to Geoffrey Chaucer he took it and made the
most of it. Indeed, the works of the great poets
teach us to hold invention somewhat cheap. The
Provençal rhymers did the best to invent things
that nobody ever thought of before, and they succeeded
in producing what nobody ever thought of
again. He must be a very great poet indeed who
can afford to say anything new.</p>

<p>In the great poets I think there is always a flavor
of race or country which gives them a peculiar
nearness to those of the same blood, and where the
face of the individual nature is most marked, it
will be found that the type of family is also most
deeply stamped. It is remarkable that Chaucer,
who probably spoke French as often and as familiarly
as English, who levied his contributions upon
Norman, Italian, and Latin writers, should yet have
become (with an exception) the most truly English
of our poets.</p>

<p>In endeavoring to point out what seem to be the
peculiar characteristics of Chaucer, I think we shall
find one of the chief to be this—that he is the first
poet who has looked to nature as a motive of conscious
emotion. Accordingly, his descriptions are
always simple and addressed to the eye rather than
to the mind, or to the fancy rather than to the imagination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Very often he is satisfied with giving a
list of flowers with no epithet, or one expressive
of color or perfume only.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell here read a number of passages from
the “Assembly of Fowls” and other poems of
Chaucer, with an extract from Spenser.</p>

<p>Now I observe that all Chaucer’s epithets are primary,
or such as give birth to the feeling; and all
Shakspeare’s secondary, or such as the feeling gives
birth to. In truth, Shakspeare’s imagination is
always dramatic, even in his narrative poems, and
it was so abundant that the mere overflow of it has
colored the very well-springs of the English language,
and especially of English poetry. On Chaucer,
nature seems to have always smiled (except in
winter, which he cordially hated), and no rumor of
man’s fall appears to have reached the trees and
birds and flowers. Nature has taken to thinking
lately, and a moral jumps up out of a blossom, like
a jack-in-a-box.</p>

<p>Another characteristic which we find in all the
poems where Chaucer speaks in his own person is
a sentiment of <i>seclusion</i>. He always dreams of
walking in a park or a garden walled-in on every
side. It is not narrowness but privacy that he
delights in, and a certain feeling of generous limitation.
In this his poems are the antithesis of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Milton’s, which always give a feeling of great
spaces.</p>

<p>In description it would be hard to find Chaucer’s
superior. His style is distinguished always by an
energetic simplicity, which is a combination exceedingly
rare. It was apparently natural to him.
But when he is describing anything that he loves,
here is an inexpressible tenderness, as if his eyes
filled with tears. His narrative flows on like one
of our inland rivers, sometimes hastening a little,
and in its eddies seeming to run sunshine; sometimes
lingering smoothly, while here and there a
beautiful quiet thought, a pure feeling, a golden-hearted
verse opens as quietly as a water-lily, and
makes no ripple. In modern times the desire for
startling expression is so strong that people hardly
think a thought is good for anything unless it goes
off with a <i>pop</i> like a gingerbeer cork.</p>

<p>In Chaucer’s pathetic passages (and they are
many), the presence of <i>pity</i> is a thing to be noticed—and
the more so as he is the best pathetic story-teller
among the English, and, except Dante, among
the modern poets. Chaucer, when he comes to the
sorrow of his story, seems to croon over the
thoughts, and soothe them, and handle them with
a pleasant compassionateness, as a child treats a
wounded bird which he cannot make up his heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
to let go, and yet fears to close his fingers too
firmly upon.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell, in illustration, read from the “Man
of Law’s Tale,” and other of the poems.</p>

<p>What I have said of Chaucer’s pathos is equally
true of his humor. It never <i>in</i>vades a story, but
<i>per</i>vades it. It circulates through all his comic
tales like lively blood, and never puddles on the
surface any unhealthy spots of extravasation. And
this I take to be the highest merit of narrative—diffusion
without diffuseness.</p>

<p>I have not spoken yet of Chaucer’s greatest work,
the “Canterbury Tales.” He has been greatly commended
for his skill in the painting of character,
and, indeed, nothing too good can be said of him in
this respect. But I think it is too much the fashion
to consider Chaucer as one of those Flemish
painters who are called realists because they never
painted the reality, but only the <i>material</i>. It is true
that Chaucer is as minute in his costume as if he
were illuminating a missal. Nothing escapes him—the
cut of the beard, the color of the jerkin, the
rustiness of the sword. He could not help this, his
eye for the picturesque is so quick and sure. But
in drawing the character it is quite otherwise.
Here his style is large and free, and he emphasizes,
but not too strongly, those points only which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
essential, and which give variety to his picture
without any loss to the keeping. For he did not
forget that he was painting history and not a portrait.
If his character of the good parson (which
still stands not only unmatched but unapproached
by the many later attempts at the same thing)
seem an exception, it is yet in truth a confirmation
of what I have said. For, in this case, for the very
sake of <i>keeping</i>, it was necessary to be more full
and careful, because the <i>good</i> parson alone must
balance the friar, the pardoner, and all the other
clerical personages who are almost unmixedly evil.
Justice is always a leading quality in great minds,
and by this single figure on one side and the group
on the other Chaucer satirizes the Church, as it
can only be satirized, by showing that it contrasts
with that true religion with which it should be
identical. And was there ever anything so happy
as Chaucer’s satire! Commonly satire is unhappy,
but Chaucer’s is positively more kindly than the
panegyric of some poets.</p>

<p>In calling Chaucer <i>genial</i> I chose the word with
forethought. This geniality made it impossible
that his satire should be intellectual. The satire of
the intellect deals with the outside only, trying the
thing satirized by a rigid standard. But it results
from Chaucer’s genial temperament that justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
in him is so equipoised by love that it becomes
mercy, which is the point of rest between absolute
law and human frailty. Therefore Chaucer, properly
speaking, is not a satirist but a humorist; in
other words, his satire is imaginative, and thus, in
perfect subordination to narrative (though not to
dramatic) art, he makes his characters satirize
themselves. I suppose that no humorist ever
makes anybody so thoroughly an object of satire
as himself—but then one always satirizes himself
kindly because he sees all sides. Falstaff is an example
of this. Now this is just the character of
imaginative or humorous satire, that the humorist
enters his subject, assumes his consciousness, and
works wholly from within. Accordingly when
Chaucer makes his Frere or Pardoner expose all
his own knaveries, we feel not as if he said, “See
what a precious scamp this fellow is,” but “This is
the way <i>we</i> poor devils play fantastic tricks before
high heaven.” The butt of the humorist is Man
(including himself and us); the butt of the satirist
is always individual man. The humorist says <i>we</i>;
the moralist and satirist, <i>thou</i>. Here is the strength
of the great imaginative satirist of modern times,
Mr. Thackeray.</p>

<p>In satire, the antithesis of Chaucer is Pope; as a
painter of life and manners, Crabbe, who had great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
powers of observation without imagination. Therefore
what is simplicity in Chaucer is poverty in
Crabbe.</p>

<p>Chaucer is the first great poet who held up a mirror
to contemporary life in its objectivity, and for
the mere sake of its picturesqueness—that is, he is
the first great poet who has treated To-day as if it
were as good as Yesterday. Dante wrote life also,
but it was his own life, and what is more, his own
interior life. All his characters are represented in
their relation to <i>that</i>. But Chaucer reflected life in
its large sense—the life of <i>men</i>, from the knight to
the ploughman. Thus it is that he always quietly
and naturally rises above the Conventional into the
Universal. And so his great poem lives forever in
that perennial contemporaneousness which is the
great privilege of genius. Thus the man of genius
has a double immortality—in heaven and
on earth at the same time; and this is what makes
it good to <i>be</i> a genius at all, that their beauty and
their goodness live after them, and every generation
of men can say of them—They are <i>our</i> friends
also.</p>

<p>I know not how to sum up what we feel about
Chaucer except by saying, what would have pleased
him most, that we <i>love</i> him. I would write on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
first page of his volume the inscription which he
puts over the gate in his “Assembly of Fowls”:</p>

<p>Chaucer had been in his grave one hundred
and fifty years before England had secreted
choice material enough to produce another great
poet. Or, perhaps, we take it for granted that Nature
understands her own business too well to make
such productions cheap. Beauty, we know, has no
charm like that of its eternal unexpectedness, and
the best delight is that which blossoms from a stem
of bare and long days.</p>

<p>Or is it that the spirit of man, of every race of
men, has its fatal ebbs and floods, its oscillations
between the fluid ideal and the solid matter-of-fact,
so that the doubtful line of shore between is in
one generation a hard sandy actuality, with only
such resemblances of beauty as a dead sea-moss
here and there, and in the next is whelmed with
those graceful curves of ever-gaining, ever-receding
foam, and that dance of joyous spray which
knows not, so bright is it, whether it be sea or
sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>What English Poetry was between Chaucer and
Spenser there is no need to say. Scotland had
given birth to two or three poets of that kind
which is qualified by the epithet <i>national</i>, which is
as much as saying that they took account only of
the universe to the north-northeast corner of human
nature instead of the whole circumference of it.
England in the meanwhile had been enriched with
Sternhold and Hopkins, but on the whole, the most
important event between the death of Chaucer and
the publication of the “Faëry Queene” was the introduction
of blank verse. Perhaps the blank poetry
suggested it.</p>

<p>Before the “Faëry Queene,” also, two long poems
were printed and popular—the “Mirror for Magistrates,”
and “Albion’s England.” How the first of
these was ever read it is hard to conceive, unless
we accept the theory of some theologians that our
earth is only a kind of penal colony where men are
punished for sins committed in some previous state
of existence. The other was the work of one Warner,
a conveyancer, and has a certain philological value
now from its abounding in the popular phrases of
the day. It is worth notice, also, as containing the
most perfect example in the English language of
what is called a conceit. It occurs in his account
of Queen Elinor’s treatment of Fair Rosamond:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With that she dashed her on the lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So dyed double red;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hard was the heart that struck the blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Soft were the lips that bled.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Which is nonsense and not poetry, though Dr.
Percy admired it. Dr. Donne, and the poets whom
Dr. Johnson called metaphysical (as if all poets
are not so), is thought to be full of conceits. But
the essence of a conceit is not in a comparison
being far-fetched,—the imagination can make fire
and water friendly when it likes,—but in playing
upon the meanings of two words where one is taken
in a metaphorical sense. This is a mark of the
superficial mind always; whereas Donne’s may be
called a subterficial one, which went down to the
roots of thought instead of playing with its
blossoms.</p>

<p>Not long after the “Faëry Queene” were published
the “Polyolbion” of Drayton, and the “Civil
Wars” of Daniel. Both of these men were respectable
poets (especially Drayton), but neither of them
could reconcile poetry with gazetteering or chronicle-making.
They are as unlike as a declaration in
love and a declaration in law.</p>

<p>This was the period of the Saurians in English
Poetry, interminable poems, book after book and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
canto after canto, like far-stretching <i>vertebræ</i>, prodigious
creatures that rendered the earth unfit for
the dwelling of Man. They are all dead now, the unwieldy
monsters—ichthyo-, plesio-, and megalosauri—they
all sleep well, and their huge remains are
found imbedded in those vast morasses, the “Collections
of the Poets.” We wonder at the length of
face and general atra-bilious look that mark the
portraits of that generation; but it is no marvel
when even the poetry was such downright hard
work. Poems of this sort might have served to
while away the three-centuried evening of antediluvian
lives. It is easy to understand how our
ancestors could achieve great things when they encountered
such hardships for mere amusement. If
we agree with Horace in pitying the pre-Homeric
heroes because they were without poets, we may
sincerely commiserate our forefathers of that generation
because they had them. The reading of
one of these productions must have been nearly as
long a business as the taking of Troy, and deserved a
poet to sing it. Perhaps fathers, when their time on
earth was up, folded the leaf down and left the task
to be finished by their sons—a dreary inheritance.</p>

<p>The popularity of such works shows the insatiable
thirst of the human soul for something which at
least tried to be beyond mere matter-of-fact. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
thirst for the ideal transmuted these books into
poetry, just as the eternal drought of the desert
turns muddy water into nectar, and the famine of
the shipwrecked sailor gives a flavor beyond French
cookery to a soup made of old shoes (<i>potage aux
choux</i>). But meanwhile Nature, who loves surprises,
was quietly preparing a noble one. A new poet had
been born, and came upon that arid century fresh
and dewy as out of the first dawn that waked the
birds in Eden. A great poet is always impossible—till
he comes, and then he seems the simplest thing
in the world to the commentators. He got this notice
here and the other there; similar subjects had
been treated by such a one, and the metre first
used by another. They give us all the terms of
the equation; satisfy us that <i>a</i> plus <i>b</i> minus <i>c</i>
equals <i>x</i>, only we are left in the dark as to what
<i>x</i> is. The genius continues to be an unknown
quantity. The great poet is as original as to-morrow’s
sunrise, which will take the old clouds and vapors,
and little household smokes of our poor, worn-out
earth to make a miracle out of, and transfigure
the old hills and fields and houses with the enchantment
of familiar novelty. It is this power of
being at once familiar and novel that distinguishes
the primary poets. They give us a new heaven
and a new earth without the former things having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
passed away,—whose very charm is that they have
not,—a new heaven and a new earth that we can
possess by the fireside, in the street, and the counting-room.</p>

<p>Edmund Spenser was born, like Chaucer, in London,
in 1553, when Cervantes was six years old.
That sixteenth century was a miraculous one. Scarce
any other can show such a concurrence of great
brains. Mothers must have expected an attack of
genius among their children, as we look for measles
or whooping-cough now. While Spenser was yet
delving over the <i>propria quæ maribus</i>, Shakspeare
was stretching out his baby arms and trying to get
the moon to play with, and the little Bacon, chewing
upon his coral, had already learned the impenetrability
of matter. It almost takes one’s breath away
to think that at the same time “Hamlet” and the
“Novum Organon” were at the mercy of teething
and the scarlet fever, unless, indeed, destiny takes
care to lock the doors against those child-stealing
gypsies when she leaves such precious things about.</p>

<p>Of Spenser’s personal history we know very little.
He was educated at Cambridge, where he took the
degree of Master of Arts in 1576. He is supposed
to have passed the three following years with some
relations in the country, where he wrote verses and
fell in love with a lady whom he calls Rosalind, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
of whom we know nothing further unless we are
satisfied to take the portrait which Shakspeare has
associated forever with the name which he complimented
by adopting. He is said to have been
employed to carry a despatch or two, but Lord
Burleigh did not fancy him. Poor Lord Burleigh!
Sidney and Raleigh, however, were luckier. He
was recommended to the great queen, and received
at last a grant of Kilcolman Castle and three thousand
acres of land in the south of Ireland. Here
the “Faëry Queene” was in great part written. At
last came a rebellion. The wild kernes and gallow-glasses
had not the delicacy of the Emathian
conqueror, and they burned the castle, from which
Spenser and his wife with two of their children
barely escaped, leaving an infant to perish in the
flames. Spenser came to London and died broken-hearted
three months afterward, on the 16th of January,
1599. That rare nature was like a Venice
glass, meant only to mantle with the wine of the
sunniest poetry. The first drop of poisonous sorrow
shattered it.</p>

<p>In 1579 Spenser published the “Shepherd’s Calendar,”
a series of twelve eclogues, one for each
month in the year. In these poems he professedly
imitated Chaucer, whom he called his master, but
without much success. Even with the light reflected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
upon them from the lustre of his great poem, one
can find but little in them that is not dull. There
are indications in these poems, however, here and
there, of a nice ear for harmony in verse.</p>

<p>Spenser was the pure sense of the Beautiful put
into a human body only that it might have the
means of communicating with men. His own description
of Clarion, the butterfly in his “Muiopotmos,”
gives, perhaps, the best possible idea of his
own character.</p>

<p>What poet has ever left us such a portrait of
himself as this? In that butterfly Spenser has
symbolized the purely poetical nature. It will be
seen that there is no recognition of the moral sense
whatever. The poetic nature considered abstractly
craves only beauty and delight—without any
thought beyond—</p>

<p>The poetical temperament has nowhere been at
once so exquisitely defined and illustrated. Among
poets, Spenser stands for the temperament personified.</p>

<p>But how did it happen that this lightsome creature,
whose only business was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To reign in the air from earth to highest sky,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>
<p>should have attempted in his greatest work to mix
together two such incoherent things as sermon and
poem? In the first place, the age out of which a
man is born is the mother of his mind, and imprints
her own likeness more or less clearly on the features
of her child. There are two destinies from
which no one can escape, his own idiosyncrasy,
and that of the time in which he lives. Or shall
we say that where the brain is in flower of its conceptions,
the very air is full of thought-pollen, or
some wandering bee will bring it, we know not from
what far field, to hybridize the fruit?</p>

<p>In Spenser’s time England was just going through
the vinous stage of that Puritanic fermentation
which became acetous in Milton, and putrefactive
in the Fifth Monarchy men. Here was one motive.
But, besides this, it is evident that Spenser’s fancy
had been colored by the Romances which were
popular in his day; and these had all been allegorized
by the monks, who turned them into prose.
The adventure of the San Grail in the “Morte
d’Arthur” reads almost like an extract from the
“Pilgrim’s Progress.” Allegories were the fashion,
and Spenser put one on as he did a ruff, not because
it was the most convenient or becoming thing in
the world, but because other people did.</p>

<p>Another reason is probably to be found in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
nature of the man himself. The poetical temperament,
when it comes down to earth and mingles
with men, is conscious of a certain weakness. On
the unsubstantial skyey floors of its own ideal world
it walks firmly enough, and speaks the native language
of the shadowy population there. But there
is a knell at which that beautiful land dissolves like
the baseless fabric of a vision—and that is the
dinner bell. The poetical temperament becomes
keenly conscious that it also has a stomach. It
must dine, and commonly it likes rather better dinners
than other people. To this end it must carry
its wares to market where the understanding is
master. Will the understanding pay hard money
for the flowers of speech! Only what is practical
will do there. “Fine words,” grumbles the Understanding
proverbially, “butter no parsnips; and
then, to make the matter worse, the <i>parsnips</i> are
<i>ideal</i>.” “But, my dear sir,” remonstrates Temperament
mildly—“Dear me no dears,” growls Understanding.
“Everybody must earn his own salt—I
do.” “Let me read you my beautiful poem.”
“Can’t comprehend a word of it. The only language
I know a word of is my old mother tongue,
the <i>useful</i>. Look at the towns and ships I’ve built.
Nothing ideal <i>there</i>, you’ll find. Ideal, I suppose,
is a new-fangled way of spelling idle. It won’t go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
<i>here</i>.” Suddenly the <i>useful</i> seems a very solid and
powerful thing to our poor friend, the Poetic Temperament.
It begins to feel a little absurd in talking
enthusiasm to such a matter-of-fact generation.
The problem is how to translate the ideal into the
useful. How shall Master Edmund Spenser make
himself comprehensible to Master John Bull? He
will try a picture-book, and a moral one, too—he
will write an Allegory.</p>

<p>Allegory is the Imagination of the Understanding,
or what it supposes to be, which is the same thing.
It is the ideal in words of one syllable, illustrated
with cuts, and adapted to the meanest comprehension.</p>

<p>Spenser was a good and pure-minded man, and
wished probably to combine the sacred office of
Teacher with that of Poet. The preaching part of
him came afterwards in Jeremy Taylor, who was
Spenser with his singing-robes off.</p>

<p>Spenser’s mind was so thoroughly imbued with
the beautiful that he makes even the Cave of Mammon
a place one would like to live in.</p>

<p>I think it is the want of <i>human</i> interest that
makes the “Faëry Queene” so little read. Hazlitt
has said that nobody need be afraid of the allegory;
it will not bite them, nor meddle with them
unless they meddle with it. It was the first poem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
I ever read, and I had no suspicion of any double
meaning in it. If we think of the moral as we read
it will injure the effect of the poem, because we
have an instinctive feeling that Beauty includes its
own moral, and does not need to have it stuck on.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb made the most comprehensive
criticism upon Spenser when he called him the
“poets’ poet.” This was a magic mirror which he
held up to life, where only shapes of loveliness are
reflected. A joyous feeling of the beautiful thrills
through the whole poem.</p>

<p>I think that Spenser has come nearer to expressing
the unattainable something than any other poet.
He is so purely a poet of beauty that with him the
meaning does not modulate the music of the verse,
but the music is a great part of the meaning.
No poet is so splendidly superfluous as he. He
knows too well that in poetry <i>enough</i> is parsimony.
The delight of beauty is that it is like a fountain,
forever changing, forever the same, and forever
more than full.</p>

<p>Spenser has characterized his own poem in the
song which the Sirens sing to Sir Guyon in the
twelfth canto of the second book. The whole passage
also may be called his musical as distinguished
from his picturesque style.</p>

<p>In reading Spenser one may see all the great galleries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of painting without stepping over his threshold.
Michael Angelo is the only artist that he will
not find there. It may be said of him that he is not
a narrative poet at all, that he tells no stories, but
paints them.</p>

<p>I have said that among our poets Spenser stands
for the personification of the poetic sense and temperament.
In him the senses were so sublimed
and etherealized, and sympathized so harmoniously
with an intellect of the subtlest quality that, with
Dr. Donne, we “could almost say his body thought.”
This benign introfusion of sense and spirit it is
which gives his poetry the charm of crystalline
purity without loss of warmth. He is ideal without
being merely imaginative; he is sensuous without
any suggestion of flesh and blood. He is full of
feeling, and yet of such a kind that we can neither
call it mere intellectual perception of what is fair
and good and touching, nor associate it with that
throbbing warmth which leads us to call sensibility
by its human name of heart. In the world into
which he carries us there is neither space nor time,
and so far it is purely intellectual, but then it is full
of form and color and all earthly gorgeousness, and
so far it is sensual. There are no men and women
in it, and yet it throngs with airy and immortal
shapes that have the likeness of men and women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>To appreciate fully the sensuous intellectuality
of this divine poet, compare him for a moment
with Pope, who had an equal subtlety of brain
without the joyous poetic sense. Pope’s mind was
like a perfectly clear mirror hung in a drawing-room,
and reflecting with perfect precision of outline
and vividness of coloring, not man, but good
society, every grace and every folly that belong not
to human nature in its broad meaning, but as it is
subordinated by fashion. But Spenser is like a
great calm pool that lies brooding in delicious
reverie over its golden sands in some enchanted
world. If we look into it we know not if we see the
shadows of clouds and trees and castles, of bright-armored
knights and peerless dames that linger
and are gone; or whether those pellucid depths are
only a mysterious reservoir, where all the fairest
dreams of our youth, dreams that were like hopes,
and hopes that were but dreams, are visionarily
gathered. Anon a ripple, born of no breeze, but of
the poet’s own conscious joy, startles it into a dance
of sunshine that fades away around its shores in a
lapsing murmur that seems the shadow of music
rather than its substance.</p>

<p>So entirely are beauty and delight the element of
Spenser, that whenever in the “Faëry Queene” you
come upon a thought or moral reflection it gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
you a shock of unpleasant surprise, a kind of grit,
as when one’s teeth close upon a bit of gravel in
a dish of strawberries and cream. He is the
most fluent of our poets. Sensation passing over
through emotion into reverie is the characteristic
of his manner.</p>

<p>And to read him puts one in the condition of
reverie—a state of mind in which one’s thoughts
and feelings float motionless as you may see fishes
do in a swift brook, only vibrating their fins
enough to keep themselves from being swept down
the current, while their bodies yield to all its
curvings and quiver with the thrills of its fluid
and sinuous delight. It is a luxury beyond luxury
itself, for it is not only dreaming awake, but
dreaming without the trouble of doing it yourself;
letting it be done for you, in truth, by the
finest dreamer that ever lived, who has the art of
giving you all his own visions through the medium
of music.</p>

<p>Of the versification of Spenser we need attempt
no higher praise than that it belonged to him. If
we would feel the infinite variety of the Spenserian
stanza, as Spenser uses it, its musical intricacies,
its long, sliding cadences, smooth as the green slope
on the edge of Niagara, we have only to read verses
of the same measure by other poets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>As showing his pathos, Mr. Lowell read Una’s
lament on her desertion by the Red Cross Knight,
and other pieces, calling attention particularly to
the fact that his females were not women, like those
of Shakspeare, but ideal beings.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to apologize for the grossness
of our favorite old authors by saying that their age
was to blame, and not they. Spenser needs no such
excuses. He is the most perfect gentleman among
poets. Through that unrefined time, when ladies
drank a quart of ale for breakfast, and even Hamlet
can say a coarse thing to Ophelia, Spenser passes
pure and chaste as another Sir Galahad.</p>

<p>Whoever can endure unmixed delight, whoever
can tolerate music, and painting, and poetry, all in
one, whoever wishes to be rid of thought and to let
the busy anvils of the brain be silent for a time, let
him read in the “Faëry Queene.” There is a land of
pure Heart’s Ease where no ache or sorrow of spirit
can enter. If there be any poet whom we can love
and feel grateful toward, it is Edmund Spenser.</p>

</div>


<p>Between Spenser and Milton occurred the
most truly imaginative period of English
poetry. It is the time of Shakspeare and of the
other dramatists only less than he. It seems to
have been the moment in which the English mind
culminated.</p>

<p>Even if we subtract Shakspeare, the age remains
without a parallel. The English nature was just
then giving a great heave and yearn toward freedom
in politics and religion, and literature could
not fail to partake of the movement.</p>

<p>A wave of enthusiasm seemed to break over
England; all that was poetical in the people found
expression in deed or word. Everything tasted of
it—sermons and speeches as well as verses. The
travelers could not write a dry journal, but they
somehow blundered into a poetical phrase that
clings to the memory like a perfume. The sensations
of men were as fresh as Adam’s, and the
words they found to speak them in could be beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
or fragrant with as little effort as it costs
violets to be blue.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the poetry of Shakspeare
is at the same time more English and more
universally human than any that was ever written.
The two great poets who came before Shakspeare
had both of them enlarged the revenues of the
English muse. Chaucer had added character and
incident, and had shown the capacities of the language
and of the metre. Spenser left it enriched
with a luxury of diction, with harmony of verse,
and with the lovely images of the classical mythology.
But Shakspeare came in like an unthrift
heir. He squandered everything. From king to
clown he used up all character; there is no passion,
or fancy, or feeling that he has not spent; no question
of philosophy, morals, politics, or metaphysics
that he has not solved; he poured out all the
golden accumulations of diction like water. And
his younger brethren, the other dramatists, helped
him. What was there left? Certainly, this wonderful
being has expressed every sentiment, every
thought, that is universal in its relations. All the
poetry of this world he exhausted. Accordingly, in
the time immediately following this splendidly imaginative
period, we find only a development of fancy
under one or other of its disguises. Fancy deals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
with limited and personal experiences, and interests
us by the grace or perfectness of its expression of
these. The Dramatists were tremendously in earnest,
as they had need to be, to please a people
who were getting in earnest themselves. But now
the time itself was preparing a drama, and on no
mimic scene, but with England for a stage and with
all Europe for spectators. A real historical play
was in rehearsal, no petty war of York and Lancaster,
but the death-grapple of two eras. The
time was in travail with the Ishmael of Puritanism
who, exiled from his father’s house, was to found
here in this Western wilderness an empire for himself
and his wandering descendants. England herself
was turning poet, and would add her rhapsody
to the great epic of the nations.</p>

<p>That was a day of earnest and painful thinking,
and poetical temperaments naturally found relief in
turning away from actual life to the play of the
fancy. We find no trace of high imagination here.
Certainly, Herbert and Vaughan and even Quarles
are sometimes snatched into something above common
fancy by religious fervor, but how cold and
experimental is the greater part of their poetry—not
poetry, indeed, but devotional exercises in
verse. Cowley wrote imaginary love-songs to an
imaginary mistress, and Waller the same sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
stuff to a real one. Catullus revived in Herrick, a
country parson. Wither, a Puritan, wrote some
poems full of nature and feeling, and remarkable
for purity of sentiment. Donne, a deep thinker,
carried on his anatomical studies into his verse,
and dissected his thoughts and feelings to the smallest
nerve. A great many nice things got said, no
doubt, and many charming little poems were written—but
the <i>great</i> style appears no longer.</p>

<p>It was during this lull, as we may call it, that followed
the mighty day of the Dramatists, that Milton
was growing up. He was born in London on the
ninth of December, 1608, and was therefore in his
eighth year when Shakspeare died. His father was
of a good family, which still adhered to the Roman
Catholic faith. What is of more importance, he was
disinherited by <i>his</i> father for having adopted Puritan
principles; and he was a excellent musician. Milton
was very early an indefatigable student, even in
his twelfth year seldom leaving his books before
midnight. At the university he was distinguished
as a Latin scholar and writer of Latin verses. He
was intended for the Church, but had already
formed opinions of his own which put conformity
out of the question. He was by nature an Independent,
and could not, as he says, “subscribe
<i>slave</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Leaving the university in 1632, he passed the
five following years in a studious seclusion at his
father’s house at Horton, in Buckinghamshire. During
these five years he wrote most of his smaller
poems. In 1638 he set out for Italy. The most important
events of his stay in that country were his
meetings with Galileo, and the Marquis Manso, who
had been Tasso’s friend. After refreshing his Protestantism
at Geneva, he passed through France
and came back to England to find the Civil War
already begun.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson sneers at Milton for having come
home from Italy because he could not stay abroad
while his countrymen were struggling for their
freedom, and then quietly settling down as a
teacher of a few boys for bread. It might, with
equal reason, have been asked of the Doctor why,
instead of writing “Taxation no Tyranny,” he did
not volunteer in the war against the rebel American
provinces? Milton sacrificed to the cause he
thought holy something dearer to him than life—the
hope of an earthly immortality in a great poem.
He suffered his eyes to be put out for the sake of
his country as deliberately as Scævola thrust his
hand into the flame. He gave to freedom something
better than a sword—words that were victories.
Around the memories of Bradshaw and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
his illustrious brethren his deathless soldiery still
pitch their invincible tents, still keep their long-resounding
march, sure warders against obloquy
and oblivion.</p>

<p>After the death of Cromwell, Milton continued
faithful to republicanism, and on the very eve of the
Restoration published his last political tract, showing
a short and easy way to establish a Christian
commonwealth. He had long ago quarreled with
the Presbyterians in discipline, and separated from
the Independents in doctrine. For many years he
did not go within any church and had become
a Unitarian. He had begun “Paradise Lost” in
1658, and after the Restoration, with a broken fortune,
but with a constancy which nothing could
break, shattered in health, blind, and for a time in
danger, he continued the composition of it. It was
complete in 1665, when Elwood, the Quaker, had
the reading of it, and it was published in 1667.</p>

<p>The translation of the Bible had to a very great
extent Judaized the Puritan mind. England was
no longer England, but Israel. Those fierce enthusiasts
could always find Amalek and Philistia
in the men who met them in the field, and one
horn or the other of the beast in every doctrine
of their theological adversaries. The spiritual provincialism
of the Jewish race found something congenial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
in the Anglo-Saxon intellect. This element
of the Puritan character appears in Milton also, as
in that stern sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints, whose bones</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Even them who kept thy truth so pure of old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Milton’s prose there is a constant assertion of
himself as a man set apart to a divine ministry.
He seems to translate himself out of Hebrew into
English. And yet so steeped was he in Greek culture
that it is sometimes hard to say whether he
would rather call himself the messenger of Jehovah
or the son of Phœbus. Continually the fugitive
mists of dialectics are rent, and through them shine
down serene and solemn peaks that make us feel
that we are encamped about by the sacred mounts
of song, but whether of Palestine or of Greece is
doubtful. We may apply to Milton what Schiller
says of the poet, “Let the kind divinity snatch the
suckling from his mother’s breast, nourish him with
the milk of a better age, and let him come to maturity
beneath a distant Grecian sky. Then when he has
become a man let him return, a foreign shape, into
his century, not to delight it with his apparition,
but terrible, like Agamemnon’s son, to purify it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>I said that Milton had a sublime egotism. The
egotism of a great character is inspiration because
it generalizes self into universal law. It is a very
different thing from the vulgar egotism of a little
nature which contracts universal Law into self. The
one expands with a feeling that it is a part of the
law-making power, the other offers an amendment in
town-meeting as if it came from Sinai. Milton’s superb
conception of himself enters into all he does;
if <i>he</i> is blind, it is with excess of light—it is a divine
favor, an overshadowing with angel’s wings.
Phineus and Tiresias are admitted among the prophets
because they, too, had lost their sight. There
is more merit in the blindness of Mæonides than
in his “Iliad” or “Odyssey.” If the structure of <i>his</i>
mind is undramatic, why, then the English drama
is barbarous, and he will write a tragedy on a
Greek model with blind Samson for a hero.</p>

<p>It results from this that no great poet is so uniformly
self-conscious as he. Dante is individual
rather than self-conscious, and the cast-iron Dante
becomes pliable as a field of grain at the breath of
Beatrice, and his whole nature, rooted as it is, seems
to flow away in waves of sunshine. But Milton
never lets himself go for a moment. As other poets
are possessed by their theme, so is he always self-possessed,
his great theme being Milton, and his duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
being that of interpreter between John Milton and
the world. I speak it reverently—he was worth
translating.</p>

<p>We should say of Shakspeare that he had the
power of transforming himself into everything, and
of Milton that he had that of transforming everything
into himself. He is the most learned of poets.
Dante, it is true, represents all the scholarship of
his age, but Milton belonged to a more learned age,
was himself one of the most learned men in it, and
included Dante himself among his learning. No
poet is so indebted to books and so little to personal
observation as he. I thought once that he had
created out of his own consciousness those exquisite
lines in “Comus”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">A thousand fantasies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Begin to throng into my memory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And airy tongues that syllable men’s names</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But I afterwards found that he had built them
up out of a dry sentence in Marco Polo’s “Travels.”
The wealth of Milton in this respect is wonderful.
He subsidizes whole provinces of learning to spend
their revenues upon one lavish sentence, and melts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
history, poetry, mythology, and philosophy together
to make the rich Miltonic metal of a single verse.</p>

<p>The first noticeable poem of Milton is his “Hymn
of the Nativity,” and the long-enwoven harmony of
the versification is what chiefly deserves attention
in it. It is this which marks the advent of a new
power into English poetry.</p>

<p>In Spenser meaning and music are fused together;
in Shakspeare the meaning dominates
always (and I intend the sentiment as included in
the word meaning); but in Milton the music is
always a primary consideration. He is always as
much musician as poet. And he is a harmonist,
not a melodist. He loves great pomps and sequences
of verse, and his first passages move like
long processions, winding with sacred chant, and
priestly robes rich with emblematic gold, and waving
of holy banners, along the echoing aisles of some
cathedral. Accordingly, no reader of Milton can
fail to notice that he is fond of lists of proper
names which can have only an acquired imaginative
value, and in that way serve to excite our poetic
sensibility, but which also are of deep musical significance.</p>

<p>This was illustrated by reading various passages
from “Paradise Lost.”</p>

<p>Another striking peculiarity of Milton is the feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
of <i>spaciousness</i> which his poetry gives us, and
that not only in whole paragraphs, but even in single
words. His mind was one which demanded illimitable
room to turn in. His finest passages are
those in which the imagination diffuses itself over a
whole scene or landscape, or where it seems to circle
like an eagle controlling with its eye broad
sweeps of champaign and of sea, bathing itself in
the blue streams of air, and seldom drawn earthward
in the concentrated energy of its swoop.</p>

<p>This shows itself unmistakably in the epithets
of his earlier poems. In “Il Penseroso,” for example,
where he hears</p>

<p>Milton seems to produce his effects by exciting or
dilating our own imaginations; and this excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
accomplished, he is satisfied. Shakspeare, on the
other hand, seldom leaves any work to be done by
the imagination of his readers; and after we have
enjoyed the total effect of a passage, we may always
study the particulars with advantage. Shakspeare
never attaches any particular value to his
thoughts, or images, or phrases, but scatters them
with a royal carelessness. Milton seems always to
respect his; he lays out broad avenues for the triumphal
processions of his verse; covers the ground
with tapestry inwoven with figures of mythology
and romance; builds up arches rich with historic
carvings for them to march under, and accompanies
them with swells and cadences of inspiring music.
“Paradise Lost” is full of what may be called <i>vistas</i>
of verse. Notice, for example, how far off he begins
when he is about to speak of himself—as at the beginning
of the third book and of the seventh. When
you read “Paradise Lost” the feeling you have is
one of <i>vastness</i>. You float under a great sky brimmed
with sunshine, or hung with constellations; the
abyss of space is around you; thunders mutter on
the horizon; you hear the mysterious sigh of an
unseen ocean; and if the scene changes, it is with
an elemental movement like the shifting of mighty
winds. Of all books it seems most purely the work
of a disembodied mind. Of all poets he could most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
easily afford to be blind; of all, his poetry owes
least to the senses, except that of hearing; everything,
except his music, came to him through a
mental medium, and perhaps even that may have
been intellectual—as in Beethoven, who composed
behind the veil of deafness.</p>

<p>Milton is a remarkable instance of a great imaginative
faculty fed by books instead of Nature.
One has only to read the notes of the commentators
upon his poems to see how perfectly he made whatever
he took his own. Everything that he touches
swells and towers into vastness. It is wonderful to
see how, from the most withered and juiceless hint
that he met in his reading, his grand images “rise
like an exhalation”; how from the most hopeless-looking
leaden box that he found in that huge drag-net
with which he gathered everything from the
waters of learning, he could conjure a tall genius
to do his bidding.</p>

<p>That proud consciousness of his own strength,
and confidence at the same time that he is the messenger
of the Most High, never forsake him. It is
they which give him his grand manner, and make
him speak as if with the voice of a continent. He
reverenced always the sacredness of his own calling
and character. As poet, full of the lore of antiquity,
and, as prophet, charged to vindicate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
ways of God, it seems to me that I see the majestic
old man laying one hand upon the shoulder of the
Past, and the other upon that of the Future, and so
standing sublimely erect above that abject age to
pour his voice along the centuries. We are reminded
of what is told of Firdusi, whose father on
the night he was born dreamed he saw him standing
in the middle of the earth and singing so loud
and clear that he was heard in all four quarters of
the heavens at once.</p>

<p>I feel how utterly inadequate any single lecture
must be on such a theme, and how impossible it is
to say anything about Milton in an hour. I have
merely touched upon three or four points that
seemed to me most characteristic of his style, for
our concern with him is solely as a poet. Yet it
would be an unpardonable reticence if I did not say,
before I close, how profoundly we ought to reverence
the grandeur of the man, his incorruptible love
of freedom, his scholarly and unvulgar republicanism,
his scorn of contemporary success, his faith in
the future and in God, his noble frugality of life.</p>

<p>The noise of those old warfares is hushed; the
song of Cavalier and the fierce psalm of the Puritan
are silent now; the hands of his episcopal adversaries
no longer hold pen or crozier—they and their
works are dust; but he who loved truth more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
life, who was faithful to the other world while he
did his work in this; his seat is in that great cathedral
whose far-echoing aisles are the ages whispering
with blessed feet of the Saints, Martyrs,
and Confessors of every clime and creed; whose
bells sound only centurial hours; about whose
spire crowned with the constellation of the cross no
meaner birds than missioned angels hover; whose
organ music is the various stops of endless changes
breathed through by endless good; whose choristers
are the elect spirits of all time, that sing,
serene and shining as morning stars, the ever-renewed
mystery of Creative Power.</p>

<p>Neither the Understanding nor the Imagination
is sane by itself; the one becomes blank
worldliness, the other hypochondria. A very little
imagination is able to intoxicate a weak understanding,
and this appears to be the condition of
religious enthusiasm in vulgar minds. Puritanism,
as long as it had a material object to look forward
to, was strong and healthy. But Fanaticism is always
defeated by success; the moment it is established
in the repose of power, it necessarily crystallizes
into cant and formalism around any slenderest
threads of dogma; and if the intellectual fermentation
continue after the spiritual has ceased, as
it constantly does, it is the fermentation of putrefaction,
breeding nothing but the vermin of incoherent
and destructively-active metaphysic subtleties—the
maggots, as Butler, condensing Lord
Bacon, calls them, of corrupted texts. That wise
man Oliver Cromwell has been reproached for
desertion of principles because he recognized the
truth that though enthusiasm may overturn a government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
it can never carry on one. Our Puritan
ancestors came to the same conclusion, and have
been as unwisely blamed for it. While we wonder
at the prophetic imagination of those heroic souls
who could see in the little <i>Mayflower</i> the seeds of
an empire, while we honor (as it can only truly
be honored—by imitating) that fervor of purpose
which could give up everything for principle, let
us be thankful that they had also that manly English
sense which refused to sacrifice <i>their</i> principles
to the fantasy of every wandering Adoniram or
Shear-Jashub who mistook himself for Providence
as naturally and as obstinately as some lunatics
suppose themselves to be tea-pots.</p>

<p>The imaginative side of Puritanism found its poetical
expression in Milton and its prose in Bunyan.
The intellectual vagaries of its decline were to have
their satirist in Butler. He was born at Strensham
in Worcestershire in 1612, the son of a small farmer
who was obliged to pinch himself to afford his
son a grammar-school education. It is more than
doubtful whether he were ever at any university at
all. His first employment was as clerk to Mr. Jeffereys,
a Worcestershire justice of the peace, called
by the poet’s biographers an eminent one. While
in this situation he employed his leisure in study,
and in cultivating music and painting, for both of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
which arts he had a predilection. He next went
into the family of the Countess of Kent, where he
had the use of a fine library, and where he acted as
amanuensis to John Selden—the mere drippings of
whose learning were enough to make a great scholar
of him. After this he was employed (in what capacity
is unknown) in the house of Sir Samuel Luke,
an officer of Cromwell, and a rigid Presbyterian.
It was here that he made his studies for the characters
of <i>Sir Hudibras</i> and his squire, <i>Ralpho</i>, and
is supposed to have begun the composition of
his great work. There is hardly anything more
comic in “Hudibras” itself than the solemn Country
Knight unconsciously furnishing clothes from
his wardrobe, and a rope of his own twisting, to
hang himself in eternal effigy with. Butler has been
charged with ingratitude for having caricatured his
employer; but there is no hint of any obligation he
was under, and the service of a man like him must
have been a fair equivalent for any wages.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it has been asserted that Butler
did not mean Sir Samuel Luke at all, but a certain
Sir Henry Rosewell, or a certain Colonel Rolle,
both Devonshire men. And in confirmation of it we
are told that Sir Hugh de Bras was the tutelary saint
of Devonshire. Butler, however, did not have so
far to go for a name, but borrowed it from Spenser.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
He himself is the authority for the “conjecture,” as
it is called, that his hero and Sir Samuel Luke were
identical. At the end of the first canto of part first
of “Hudibras” occurs a couplet of which the last
part of the second verse is left blank. This couplet,
for want of attention to the accent, has been
taken to be in ten-syllable measure, and therefore
an exception to the rest of the poem. But it is only
where we read it as a verse of four feet that the inevitable
rhyme becomes perfectly Hudibrastic. The
knight himself is the speaker:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Butler died poor, but not in want, on the 25th of
September, 1680, in his sixty-eighth year.</p>

<p>Butler’s poem is commonly considered the type
of the burlesque—that is, as the representative of
the gravely ludicrous, which seems to occupy a
kind of neutral ground between the witty and the
humorous. But this is true of the form rather than
the matter of the poem. Burlesque appears to be
wit infused with animal spirits—satire for the
mere fun of the thing, without any suggestion of
intellectual disapproval, or moral indignation. True<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
wit is a kind of instantaneous logic which gives us
the <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i> without the intermediate
steps of the syllogism. Coleridge, with admirable
acuteness, has said that “there is such a
thing as scientific wit.” Therefore pure wit sometimes
gives an intellectual pleasure without making
us laugh. The wit that makes us laugh most freely
is that which instantly accepts another man’s premises,
and draws a conclusion from them in its own
favor. A country gentleman was once showing his
improvements to the Prince de Ligne, and, among
other things, pointed out to him a muddy spot
which he called his lake. “It is rather shallow, is
it not?” said the Prince. “I assure you, Prince, a
man drowned himself in it.” “Ah, he must have
been a flatterer, then,” answered De Ligne. Of the
same kind is the story told of one of our old Massachusetts
clergymen, Dr. Morse. At an association
dinner a debate arose as to the benefit of whipping
in bringing up children. The doctor took the affirmative,
and his chief opponent was a young minister
whose reputation for veracity was not very
high. He affirmed that parents often did harm
to their children by unjust punishment from not
knowing the facts in the case. “Why,” said he,
“the only time my father ever whipped me was
for telling the truth.” “Well,” retorted the doctor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
“it cured you of it, didn’t it?” In wit of this sort,
there is always a latent syllogism.</p>

<p>Then there is the wit which detects an unintentional
bit of satire in a word of double meaning;
as where Sir Henry Wotton takes advantage of the
phrase commonly used in his day to imply merely
residence, and finds an under meaning in it, saying
that “ambassadors were persons sent to <i>lie</i> abroad
for the service of their prince.”</p>

<p>On the other hand I think unconsciousness and
want of intention, or at least the pretense of it, is
more or less essential to the ludicrous. For this
reason what may be called the wit of events is always
ludicrous. Nothing can be more so, for example,
than the Pope’s sending a Cardinal’s hat to
John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, which arrived in
England after Henry VIII had taken off that prelate’s
head. So, when Dr. Johnson said very gravely
one day, that he had <i>often thought</i> that if he had a
harem he would dress all the ladies in white linen,
the unintentional incongruity of the speech with
the character of the great moralist threw Boswell
into an ecstasy of laughter. Like this is the ludicrousness
of Pope Paul III writing to the Council
of Trent “that they should begin with original sin,
observing yet a due respect unto the Emperor.”</p>

<p>Captain Basil Hall, when he traveled in this country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
found the Yankees a people entirely destitute
of wit and humor. Perhaps our gravity, which
ought to have put him on the right scent, deceived
him. I do not know a more perfect example of wit
than something which, as I have heard, was said to
the captain himself. Stopping at a village inn there
came up a thunderstorm, and Captain Hall, surprised
that a new country should have reached
such perfection in these meteorological manufactures,
said to a bystander, “Why, you have very
heavy thunder here.” “Well, yes,” replied the
man, “we <i>du</i>, considerin’ the number of inhabitants.”
Here is another story which a stage-driver
told me once. A wag on the outside of the coach
called to a man by the roadside who was fencing
some very poor land: “I say, mister, what are you
fencing that pasture for? It would take forty acres
on’t to starve a middle-sized cow.” “Jesso; and
I’m a-fencing of it to keep eour kettle eout.”</p>

<p>Now in the “forty acre” part of this story we
have an instance of what is called American exaggeration,
and which I take to be the symptom of
most promise in Yankee fun. For it marks that
desire for intensity of expression which is one
phase of imagination. Indeed many of these sayings
are purely imaginative; as where a man said
of a painter he knew, that “he painted a shingle so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
exactly like marble that when it fell into the river
it sunk.” A man told me once that the people of
a certain town were so universally dishonest that
“they had to take in their stone walls at night.”
In some of these stories imagination appears yet
more strongly, and in that contradictory union with
the understanding lies at the root of highest humor.
For example, a coachman driving up some steep
mountains in Vermont was asked if they were as
steep on the other side also. “Steep! chain-lightnin’
couldn’t go down ’em without the breechin’ on.” I
believe that there is more latent humor among the
American people than in any other, and that it will
one day develop itself and find expression through
Art.</p>

<p>If we apply the definitions we have made to
Butler’s poem, we shall find that it is not properly
humorous at all; that the nearest approach to the
humorous is burlesque. Irony is Butler’s favorite
weapon. But he always has an ulterior object.
His characters do not live at all, but are only caricatured
effigies of political enemies stuffed with
bran and set up as targets for his wit. He never
lets us forget for a moment that Presbyterian and
Independent are primarily knaves and secondarily
men. The personality never by accident expands
into humanity. There is not a trace of imagination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
or of sympathy in his poem. It is pure satire, and
intellectual satire only. There is as much creativeness
in Trumbull’s “McFingal,” or Fessenden’s
“Terrible Tractoration” as in “Hudibras.” Butler
never works from within, but stands spectator
covering his victims with merciless ridicule; and
we enjoy the fun because his figures are as mere
nobodies as Punch and Judy, whose misfortunes
are meant to amuse us, and whose unreality is part
of the sport. The characters of truly humorous
writers are as real to us as any of our acquaintances.
We no more doubt the existence of the
Wife of Bath, of Don Quixote and Sancho, of Falstaff,
Sir Roger de Coverley, Parson Adams, the
Vicar, Uncle Toby, Pickwick or Major Pendennis,
than we do our own. They are the contemporaries
of every generation forever. They are our immortal
friends whose epitaph no man shall ever write.
The only incantation needed to summon them is the
taking of a book from our shelf, and they are with
us with their wisdom, their wit, their courtesy, their
humanity, and (dearer than all) their weaknesses.</p>

<p>But the figures of Butler are wholly contemporaneous
with himself. They are dead things
nailed to his age, like crows to a barn-door, for an
immediate <i>in terrorem</i> purpose, to waste and blow
away with time and weather. The Guy Fawkes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
of a Fifth of November procession has as much
manhood in it.</p>

<p>Butler, then, is a wit—in the strictest sense of
the word—with only such far-off hints at humor
as lie in a sense of the odd, the droll, or the ludicrous.
But in wit he is supreme. “Hudibras” is
as full of point as a paper of pins; it sparkles like
a phosphorescent sea, every separate drop of which
contains half a dozen little fiery lives. Indeed, the
fault of the poem (if it can be called a fault) is that
it has too much wit to be easy reading.</p>

<p>Butler had been a great reader, and out of the
dryest books of school divinity, Puritan theology,
metaphysics, medicine, astrology, mathematics, no
matter what, his brain secreted wit as naturally as
a field of corn will get so much silex out of a soil
as would make flints for a whole arsenal of old-fashioned
muskets, and where even Prometheus
himself could not have found enough to strike a
light with. I do sincerely believe that he would
have found fun in a joke of Senator—well, any
senator; and that is saying a great deal. I speak
of course, of senators at Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell illustrated his criticism by copious
quotations from “Hudibras.” He concluded thus:</p>

<p>It would not be just to leave Butler without adding
that he was an honest and apparently disinterested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
man. He wrote an indignant satire against
the vices of Charles the Second’s court. Andrew
Marvel, the friend of Milton, and the pattern of incorruptible
Republicanism, himself a finer poet and
almost as great a wit as Butler—while he speaks
contemptuously of the controversialists and satirists
of his day, makes a special exception of “Hudibras.”
I can fancy John Bunyan enjoying it furtively, and
Milton, if he had had such a thing as fun in him,
would have laughed over it.</p>

<p>Many greater men and greater poets have left
a less valuable legacy to their countrymen than
Butler, who has made them the heirs of a perpetual
fund of good humor, which is more nearly allied to
good morals than most people suspect.</p>

<p>There is nothing more curious, whether in the
history of individual men or of nations, than
the reactions which occur at more or less frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>The human mind, both in persons and societies,
is like a pendulum which, the moment it has
reached the limit of its swing in one direction, goes
inevitably back as far on the other side, and so on
forever.</p>

<p>These reactions occur in everything, from the
highest to the lowest, from religion to fashions of
dress. The close crop and sober doublet of the
Puritan were followed by the laces and periwigs of
Charles the Second. The scarlet coats of our
grandfathers have been displaced by as general a
blackness as if the world had all gone into mourning.
Tight sleeves alternate with loose, and the
full-sailed expanses of Navarino have shrunk to
those close-reefed phenomena which, like Milton’s
Demogorgon, are the <i>name</i> of bonnet without its
appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>English literature, for half a century from the
Restoration, showed the marks of both reaction
and of a kind of artistic vassalage to France. From
the compulsory saintship and short hair of the
Roundheads the world rushed eagerly toward a
little wickedness and a wilderness of wig. Charles
the Second brought back with him French manners,
French morals, and French taste. The fondness
of the English for foreign fashions had long
been noted. It was a favorite butt of the satirists
of Elizabeth’s day. Everybody remembers what
<i>Portia</i> says of the English lord: “How oddly is
he suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy,
his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany,
and his behavior everywhere.”</p>

<p>Dryden is the first eminent English poet whose
works show the marks of French influence, and a
decline from the artistic toward the artificial, from
nature toward fashion. Dryden had known Milton,
had visited the grand old man probably in that
“small chamber hung with rusty green,” where he
is described as “sitting in an elbow-chair, neatly
dressed in black, pale but not cadaverous”; or
had found him as he “used to sit in a gray, coarse
cloth coat, at the door of his house near Bunhill
Fields, in warm, sunny weather, to enjoy the fresh
air.” Dryden undertook to put the “Paradise Lost”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
into rhyme, and on Milton’s leave being asked, he
said, rather contemptuously, “Ay, he may <i>tag</i> my
verses if he will.” He also said that Dryden was
a “good rhymist, but no poet.” Dryden turned
the great epic into a drama called “The State of
Innocence,” and intended for representation on the
stage. Sir Walter Scott dryly remarks that the
<i>costume</i> of our first parents made it rather an
awkward thing to bring them before the footlights.
It is an illustration of the character of the times
that Dryden makes Eve the mouthpiece of something
very like obscenity. Of the taste shown by
such a travesty nothing need be said.</p>

<p>In the poems of Dryden nothing is more striking
than the alternations between natural vigor and
warmth of temperament and the merest common-places
of diction. His strength lay chiefly in the understanding,
and for weight of sterling sense and
masculine English, and force of argument, I know
nothing better than his prose. His mind was a fervid
one, and I think that in his verse he sometimes
mistook metrical enthusiasm for poetry. In his
poems we find wit, fancy, an amplitude of nature, a
rapid and graphic statement of the externals and
antitheses of character, and a dignified fluency of
verse rising sometimes to majesty—but not much
imagination in the high poetic meaning of the term.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>I have only spoken of his poems at all because
they stand midway between the old era, which died
with Milton and Sir Thomas Browne, and the new
one which was just beginning. In the sixty years
extending from 1660 to 1720, more French was imported
into the language than at any other time
since the Norman Conquest. What is of greater
importance, it was French ideas and sentiments
that were coming in now, and which shaped the
spirit and, through that, the form of our literature.</p>

<p>The condition of the English mind at the beginning
of the last century was one particularly capable
of being magnetized from across the Channel.
The loyalty of everybody, both in politics and religion,
had been dislocated. A generation of materialists
was to balance the over-spiritualism of the
Puritans. The other world had had its turn long
enough, and now <i>this</i> world was to have its chance.
There seems to have been a universal skepticism,
and in its most dangerous form—that is, united
with a universal pretense of conformity. There
was an unbelief that did not believe even in itself.
Dean Swift, who looked forward to a bishopric,
could write a book whose moral, if it had any, was
that one religion was about as good as another, and
accepted a cure of souls when it was doubtful if he
thought men had any souls to be saved, or, at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
rate, that they were worth saving if they had. The
answer which Pulci’s <i>Margutte</i> makes to <i>Morgante</i>,
when he asks him if he believed in Christ or Mahomet,
would have expressed well enough the creed
of the majority of that generation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Margutte answered then, To tell thee truly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My faith in black’s no greater than in azure;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But I believe in capons, roast meat, bouilli,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And above all in wine—and carnal pleasure.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was impossible that anything truly great—great,
I mean, on the moral and emotional as well
as on the intellectual sides—could be produced in
such a generation. But something intellectually
great could be, and was. The French mind, always
stronger in the perceptive and analytic than in the
imaginative faculty, loving precision, grace, and
fineness, had brought wit and fancy, and the elegant
arts of society, to the perfection, almost, of science.
Its ideal in literature was to combine the appearance
of carelessness and gayety of thought with
intellectual exactness of statement. Its influence,
then, in English literature will appear chiefly in
neatness and facility of expression, in point of epigrammatic
compactness of phrase, and these in conveying
conventional rather than universal experiences;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
in speaking for good society rather than
for man.</p>

<p>Thus far in English poetry we have found life
represented by Chaucer, the real life of men and
women; the ideal or interior life as it relates to
this world, by Spenser; what may be called imaginative
life, by Shakspeare; the religious sentiment,
or interior life as it relates to the other
world, by Milton. But everything aspires toward
a rhythmical utterance of itself, and accordingly
the intellect and life, as it relates to what may be
called the world, were waiting for their poet. They
found or made a most apt one in Alexander Pope.</p>

<p>He stands for perfectness of intellectual expression,
and it is a striking instance how much success
and permanence of reputation depend upon
conscientious and laborious finish as well as upon
natural endowments.</p>

<p>I confess that I come to the treatment of Pope
with diffidence. I was brought up in the old superstition
that he was the greatest poet that ever lived,
and when I came to find that I had instincts of my
own, and my mind was brought in contact with the
apostles of a more esoteric doctrine of poetry, I felt
that ardent desire for smashing the idols I had been
brought up to worship, without any regard to their
artistic beauty, which characterizes youthful zeal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
What was it to me that Pope was a master of style?
I felt, as Addison says in his “Freeholder” in answering
an argument in favor of the Pretender because
he could speak English and George I could
not, “that I did not wish to be tyrannized over in
the best English that was ever spoken.” There was
a time when I could not read Pope, but disliked
him by instinct, as old Roger Ascham seems to
have felt about Italy when he says: “I was once
in Italy myself, but I thank God my abode there
was only nine days.”</p>

<p>But Pope fills a very important place in the history
of English poetry, and must be studied by
every one who would come to a clear knowledge of
it. I have since read every line that Pope ever
wrote, and every letter written by or to him, and
that more than once. If I have not come to the
conclusion that he is the greatest of poets, I believe
I am at least in a condition to allow him every
merit that is fairly his. I have said that Pope as a
literary man represents precision and grace of expression;
but, as a fact, he represents something
more—nothing less, namely, than one of those external
controversies of taste which will last as long
as the Imagination and Understanding divide men
between them. It is not a matter to be settled by
any amount of argument or demonstration. Men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
are born Popists or Wordsworthians, Lockists or
Kantists; and there is nothing more to be said of
the matter. We do not hear that the green spectacles
persuaded the horse into thinking that shavings
were grass.</p>

<p>That reader is happiest whose mind is broad
enough to enjoy the natural school for its nature
and the artificial for its artificiality, provided they
be only good of their kind. At any rate, we must
allow that a man who can produce one perfect work
is either a great genius or a very lucky one. As
far as we who read are concerned, it is of secondary
importance which. And Pope has done this in the
“Rape of the Lock.” For wit, fancy, invention, and
keeping, it has never been surpassed. I do not say
that there is in it poetry of the highest order, or
that Pope is a poet whom any one would choose as
the companion of his best hours. There is no inspiration
in it, no trumpet call; but for pure entertainment
it is unmatched.</p>

<p>The very earliest of Pope’s productions gives indications
of that sense and discretion, as well as
wit, which afterwards so eminently distinguished
him. The facility of expression is remarkable, and
we find also that perfect balance of metre which he
afterwards carried so far as to be wearisome. His
pastorals were written in his sixteenth year, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
their publication immediately brought him into
notice. The following four verses from the first
Pastoral are quite characteristic in their antithetic
balance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You that, too wise for pride, too good for power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enjoy the glory to be great no more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And carrying with you all the world can boast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To all the world illustriously are lost.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sentiment is affected, and reminds one of
that future period of Pope’s correspondence with
his friends, where Swift, his heart corroding with
disappointed ambition at Dublin, Bolingbroke raising
delusive turnips at his farm, and Pope pretending
to disregard the lampoons which embittered
his life, played together the solemn farce of
affecting to despise the world which it would have
agonized them to be forgotten by.</p>

<p>In Pope’s next poem, the “Essay on Criticism,”
the wit and poet become apparent. It is full of
clear thoughts compactly expressed. In this poem,
written when Pope was only twenty-one, occur
some of those lines which have become proverbial,
such as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A little learning is a dangerous thing;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For fools rush in where angels fear to tread;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">True Wit is Nature to advantage dressed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What oft was thought, but ne’er so well expressed;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For each ill author is as bad a friend.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In all these we notice that terseness in which (regard
being had to his especial range of thought)
Pope has never been equaled. One cannot help
being struck also with the singular <i>discretion</i> which
the poem gives evidence of. I do not know where
to look for another author in whom it appeared
so early; and considering the vivacity of his mind
and the constantly besetting temptation of his wit,
it is still more wonderful. In his boyish correspondence
with poor old Wycherly, one would suppose
him to be a man and Wycherly the youth.
Pope’s understanding was no less vigorous than his
fancy was lightsome and sprightly.</p>

<p>I come now to what in itself would be enough to
have immortalized him as a poet, the “Rape of the
Lock,” in which, indeed, he appears more purely as
a poet than in any other of his productions. Elsewhere
he has shown more force, more wit, more
reach of thought, but nowhere such a truly artistic
combination of elegance and fancy. His genius
has here found its true direction, and the very same
artificiality which in his Pastorals was unpleasing
heightens the effect and adds to the general keeping.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
As truly as Shakspeare is the poet of man
as God made him, dealing with great passions and
innate motives, so truly is Pope the poet of society,
the delineator of manners, the exposer of those motives
which may be called acquired, whose spring is
in institutions and habits of purely worldly origin.</p>

<p>The whole poem more truly deserves the name
of a creation than anything Pope ever wrote. The
action is confined to a world of his own, the supernatural
agency is wholly of his own contrivance,
and nothing is allowed to overstep the limitations
of the subject. It ranks by itself as one of the
purest works of human fancy. Whether that fancy
be truly poetical or not is another matter. The perfection
of form in the “Rape of the Lock” is to me
conclusive evidence that in it the natural genius of
Pope found fuller and freer expression than in any
other of his poems. The others are aggregates of
brilliant passages rather than harmonious wholes.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell gave a detailed analysis of the poem,
with extracts of some length.</p>

<p>The “Essay on Man” has been praised and admired
by men of the most opposite beliefs, and men
of no belief at all. Bishops and free-thinkers have
met here on a common ground of sympathetic approval.
And, indeed, there is no particular faith
in it. It is a droll medley of inconsistent opinions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
It proves only two things beyond a question: that
Pope was not a great thinker; and that wherever
he found a thought, no matter what, he would express
it so tersely, so clearly, and with such smoothness
of versification, as to give it an everlasting
currency. Hobbes’s unwieldy “Leviathan,” left
stranded on the shore of the last age and nauseous
with the stench of its selfishness—from this Pope
distilled a fragrant oil with which to fill the brilliant
lamps of his philosophy, lamps like those in the
tombs of alchemists, that go out the moment the
healthy air is let in upon them. The only positive
doctrine in the poem is the selfishness of Hobbes
set to music, and the pantheism of Spinoza brought
down from mysticism to commonplace. Nothing
can be more absurd than many of the dogmas
taught in the “Essay on Man.”</p>

<p>The accuracy on which Pope prided himself, and
for which he is commended, was not accuracy of
thought so much as of expression. But the supposition
is that in the “Essay on Man” Pope did not
know what he was writing himself. He was only
the condenser and epigrammatizer of Bolingbroke—a
fitting St. John for such a gospel. Or if he <i>did</i>
know, we can account for the contradictions by
supposing that he threw in some of the commonplace
moralities to conceal his real drift. Johnson asserts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
that Bolingbroke in private laughed at Pope’s having
been made the mouthpiece of opinions which
he did not hold. But this is hardly probable when
we consider the relations between them. It is giving
Pope altogether too little credit for intelligence
to suppose that he did not understand the principles
of his intimate friend.</p>

<p>Dr. Warburton makes a rather lame attempt to
ward off the charge of Spinozism from the “Essay
on Man.” He would have found it harder to show
that the acknowledgment of any divine revelation
would not overthrow the greater part of its teachings.
If Pope intended by his poem all that the
Bishop takes for granted in his commentary, we
must deny him what is usually claimed as his first
merit—clearness. If we did <i>not</i>, we grant him
clearness as a writer at the expense of sincerity as
a man. Perhaps a more charitable solution of the
difficulty is that Pope’s precision of thought was
not equal to his polish of style.</p>

<p>But it is in his “Moral Essays” and part of his
“Satires” that Pope deserves the praise which he
himself desired—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Happily to steer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From grave to gay, from lively to severe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Correct with spirit, eloquent with ease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Intent to reason, or polite to please.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>
<p>Here Pope must be allowed to have established a
style of his own, in which he is without a rival.
One can open upon wit and epigram at every page.</p>

<p>In his epistle on the characters of woman, no one
who has ever known a noble woman will find much
to please him. The climax of his praise rather
degrades than elevates:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O blest in temper, whose unclouded ray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can make to-morrow cheerful as to-day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She who can love a sister’s charms, or hear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sighs for a daughter with unwounded ear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She who ne’er answers till a husband cools,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or if she rules him, never shows she rules,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Charms by accepting, by submitting sways,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet has her humor most when she obeys;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let fops or fortune fly which way they will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disdains all loss of tickets, or codille,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spleen, vapors, or smallpox, above them all;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mistress of herself though china fall.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The last line is very witty and pointed; but consider
what an ideal of womanly nobleness he must
have had who praises his heroine for not being
jealous of her daughter.</p>

<p>It is very possible that the women of Pope’s time
were as bad as they could be, but if God made
poets for anything it was to keep alive the traditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
of the pure, the holy, and the beautiful. I
grant the influence of the age, but there is a sense
in which the poet is of no age, and Beauty, driven
from every other home, will never be an outcast
and a wanderer while there is a poet-nature left;
will never fail of the tribute at least of a song. It
seems to me that Pope had a sense of the nice
rather than of the beautiful. His nature delighted
in the blemish more than in the charm.</p>

<p>Personally, we know more about Pope than about
any of our poets. He kept no secret about himself.
If he did not let the cat out of the bag, he always
contrived to give her tail a pinch so that we might
know she was there. In spite of the savageness of
his satires, his disposition seems to have been a
truly amiable one, and his character as an author
was as purely fictitious as his style. I think that
there was very little real malice in him.</p>

<p>A great deal must be allowed to Pope for the age
in which he lived, and not a little, I think, for the
influence of Swift. In his own province he still
stands unapproachably alone. If to be the greatest
satirist of individual men rather than of human nature;
if to be the highest expression which the life
of court and the ball-room has ever found in verse;
if to have added more phrases to our language than
any other but Shakspeare; if to have charmed four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
generations makes a man a great poet, then he is
one. He was the chief founder of an artificial style
of writing which in his hand was living and powerful
because he used it to express artificial modes of
thinking and an artificial state of society. Measured
by any high standard of imagination, he will
be found wanting; tried by any test of wit, he is
unrivaled.</p>

<p>To what fatuities his theory of correctness led in
the next generation, when practised upon by men
who had not his genius, I shall endeavor to show in
my next lecture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LECTURE_X">LECTURE X<br><span class="small">POETIC DICTION</span></h2>


<p class="center">(<i>Friday Evening, February 9, 1855</i>)</p>

<p>No one who has read any early poems, of whatever
nation, can have failed to notice a freshness
in the language—a sort of game flavor, as it
were—that gradually wastes out of it when poetry
becomes domesticated, so to speak, and has grown to
be a mere means of amusement both to writers and
readers, instead of answering a deeper necessity
in their natures. Our Northern ancestors symbolized
the eternal newness of song by calling it the
Present, and its delight by calling it the drink of
Odin.</p>

<p>There was then a fierce democracy of words; no
grades had then been established, and no favored
ones advanced to the Upper House of Poetry. Men
had a meaning, and so their words had to have one,
too. They were not representatives of value, but
value itself. They say that Valhalla was roofed with
golden shields; that was what they believed, and
in their songs they called them golden shingles.
We should think shields the more poetical word of
the two; but to them the poetry was in the <i>thing</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
and the thought of it and the phrase took its life
and meaning from them.</p>

<p>It is one result of the admixture of foreign words
in our language that we use a great many phrases
without knowing the force of them. There is a
metaphoric vitality hidden in almost all of them,
and we talk poetry as Molière’s citizen did prose,
without ever suspecting it. Formerly men <i>named</i>
things; now we merely label them to know them
apart. The Vikings called their ships sea-horses,
just as the Arabs called their camels ships of the
desert. Capes they called sea-noses, without thinking
it an undignified term which the land would
resent. And still, where mountains and headlands
have the luck to be baptized by uncultivated persons,
Fancy stands godmother. Old Greylock, up
in Berkshire, got his surname before we had State
geologists or distinguished statesmen. So did
Great Haystack and Saddle-Mountain. Sailors give
good names, if they have no dictionary aboard, and
along our coasts, here and there, the word and
the thing agree, and therefore are poetical. Meaning
and poetry still cling to some of our common
phrases, and the crow-foot, mouse-ear, goat’s-beard,
day’s-eye, heart’s-ease, snow-drop, and many more
of their vulgar little fellow-citizens of the wood and
roadsides are as happy as if Linnæus had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
been born. Such names have a significance even
to one who has never seen the things they stand for,
but whose fancy would not be touched about a pelargonium
unless he had an acquired sympathy with
it. Our “cumulus” language, heaped together from
all quarters, is like the clouds at sunset, and every
man finds something different in a sentence, according
to his associations. Indeed, every language that
has become a literary one may be compared to a
waning moon, out of which the light of beauty fades
more and more. Only to poets and lovers does it
repair itself from its luminous fountains.</p>

<p>The poetical quality of diction depends on the
force and intensity of meaning with which it is
employed. We are all of us full of latent significance,
and let a poet have but the power to touch
us, we forthwith enrich his word with ourselves,
pouring into his verse our own lives, all our own
experience, and take back again, without knowing
it, the vitality which we had given away out of
ourselves. Put passion enough into a word, and
no matter what it is it becomes poetical; it is no
longer what it was, but is a messenger from original
man to original man, an ambassador from royal
Thee to royal Me, and speaks to us from a level of
equality. Pope, who did not scruple to employ the
thoughts of Billingsgate, is very fastidious about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
the dress they come in, and claps a tawdry livery-coat
on them, that they may be fit for the service
of so fine a gentleman. He did not mind being
coarse in idea, but it would have been torture to
him to be thought commonplace. The sin of composition
which he dreaded was,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest ten low words should creep in one dull line.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there is no more startling proof of the genius
of Shakspeare than that he always lifts the
language up to himself, and never thinks to raise
himself atop of it. If he has need of the service of
what is called a low word, he takes it, and it is remarkable
how many of his images are borrowed out
of the street and the workshop. His pen ennobled
them all, and we feel as if they had been knighted
for good service in the field. Shakspeare, as we all
know (for does not Mr. Voltaire say so?), was a vulgar
kind of fellow, but somehow or other his genius
will carry the humblest things up into the air
of heaven as easily as Jove’s eagle bore Ganymede.</p>

<p>Whatever is used with a great meaning, and conveys
that meaning to others in its full intensity, is
no longer common and ordinary. It is this which
gives their poetic force to symbols, no matter how
low their origin. The blacksmith’s apron, once
made the royal standard of Persia, can fill armies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
with enthusiasm and is as good as the oriflamme
of France. A broom is no very noble thing in itself,
but at the mast-head of a brave old De Ruyter,
or in the hands of that awful shape which Dion
the Syracusan saw, it becomes poetical. And so
the emblems of the tradesmen of Antwerp, which
they bore upon their standards, pass entirely out of
the prosaic and mechanical by being associated with
feelings and deeds that were great and momentous.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Lowell here read a poem by Dr. Donne entitled
“The Separation.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As respects Diction, <i>that</i> becomes formal and
technical when poetry has come to be considered an
artifice rather than an art, and when its sole object
is to revive certain pleasurable feelings already
conventional, instead of originating new sources of
delight. Then it is truly earth to earth; dead language
used to bury dead emotion in. This kind of
thing was carried so far by the later Scandinavian
poets that they compiled a dictionary of the metaphors
used by the elder Skalds (whose songs were
the utterance of that within them which <i>would</i> be
spoken), and satisfied themselves with a new arrangement
of them. Inspiration was taught, as we
see French advertised to be, in six lessons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>In narrative and descriptive poetry we feel that
proper keeping demands a certain choice and luxury
of words. The question of propriety becomes
one of prime importance here. Certain terms have
an acquired imaginative value from the associations
they awake in us. Certain words are more musical
than others. Some rhymes are displeasing; some
measures wearisome. Moreover, there are words
which have become indissolubly entangled with ludicrous
or mean ideas. Hence it follows that there
is such a thing as Poetic Diction, and it was this
that Milton was thinking of when he spoke of
making our English “search her coffers round.”</p>

<p>I will illustrate this. Longfellow’s “Evangeline”
opens with a noble solemnity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This is the forest primeval; the murmuring pines and the hemlocks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bearded with moss and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand like the Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced neighboring ocean</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>
<p>There is true feeling here, and the sigh of the
pines is heard in the verses. I can find only one
epithet to hang a criticism on, and that is the “<i>wail</i>
of the forest” in the last line, which is not in keeping
with the general murmur. Now I do not suppose
that the poet turned over any vocabulary to
find the words he wanted, but followed his own poetic
instinct altogether in the affair. But suppose
for a moment, that instead of being a true poet,
he had been only a gentleman versifying; suppose
he had written, “This is the primitive forest.” The
prose meaning is the same, but the poetical meaning,
the music, and the cadence would be gone out
of it, and gone forever. Or suppose that, instead
of “garments green,” he had said “dresses green”;
the idea is identical, but the phrase would have
come down from its appropriate remoteness to the
milliner’s counter. But not to take such extreme
instances, only substitute instead of “harpers
hoar,” the words “harpers gray,” and you lose
not only the alliteration, but the fine hoarse sigh
of the original epithet, which blends with it the
general feeling of the passage. So if you put
“sandy beaches” in the place of “rocky caverns,”
you will not mar the absolute truth to nature,
but you will have forfeited the relative truth to
keeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>When Bryant says so exquisitely,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">Painted moths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have <i>wandered the blue sky</i> and died again,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>we ruin the poetry, the sunny spaciousness of the
image, without altering the prose sense, by substituting</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Have <i>flown through the clear air</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the words “poetic diction” have acquired a
double meaning, or perhaps I should say there are
two kinds of poetic diction, the one true and the
other false, the one real and vital, the other mechanical
and artificial. Wordsworth for a time
confounded the two together in one wrathful condemnation,
and preached a crusade against them
both. He wrote, at one time, on the theory that the
language of ordinary life was the true dialect of
poetry, and that one word was as good as another.
He seemed even to go farther and to adopt the
Irishman’s notion of popular equality, that “one
man is as good as another, and a dale better, too.”
He preferred, now and then, prosaic words and images
to poetical ones. But he was not long in finding
his mistake and correcting it. One of his most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
tender and pathetic poems, “We are Seven,” began
thus in the first edition:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A simple child, <i>dear brother Jim</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All England laughed, and in the third edition
Wordsworth gave in and left the last half of the
line blank, as it has been ever since. If the poem
had been a translation from the Turkish and had
begun,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A simple child, dear Ibrahim,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>there would have been nothing unpoetical in it;
but the “dear brother Jim,” which would seem
natural enough at the beginning of a familiar letter,
is felt to be ludicrously incongruous at the
opening of a poem.</p>

<p>To express a profound emotion, the simpler the
language and the less removed from the ordinary
course of life the better. There is a very striking
example of this in Webster’s tragedy of “The
Duchess of Malfy.” The brother of the Duchess
has procured her murder, and when he comes in
and sees the body he merely says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died young.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Horror could not be better expressed than in
these few words, and Webster has even taken care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
to break up the verse in such a way that a too entire
consciousness of the metre may not thrust itself
between us and the bare emotion he intends
to convey.</p>

<p>In illustration, Mr. Lowell quoted from Shakspeare
(“Henry V”), Marlowe, Chapman, Dunbar,
Beaumont and Fletcher, Waller, Young, and Cawthorn.</p>

<p>These men [the poets of the eighteenth century]
were perfectly conscious of the fact that poetry is
not produced under an ordinary condition of the
mind, and accordingly, when they begin to grind
their barrel-organs, they go through the ceremony
of invoking the Muse, talk in the blandest way of
divine rages and sacred flames, and one thing or
another, and ask for holy fire to heat their little
tea-urns with as coolly as one would borrow a lucifer.
They appeal ceremoniously to the “sacred
Nine,” when the only thing really necessary to them
was the ability to count as high as the sacred ten
syllables that constituted their verse. If the Muse
had once granted their prayer, if she <i>had</i> once unveiled
her awful front to the poor fellows, they
would have hidden under their beds, every man
John of them.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century produced some true
poets, but almost all, even of them, were infected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
by the prevailing style. I cannot find any name
that expresses it better than the “Dick Swiveller
style.” As Dick always called wine the “rosy,”
sleep the “balmy,” and so forth, so did these perfectly
<i>correct</i> gentlemen always employ either a
fluent epithet or a diffuse paraphrasis to express
the commonest emotions or ideas. If they wished
to say <i>tea</i> they would have done it thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of China’s herb the infusion hot and mild.</div>

<p>A few remarks upon two of the more distinguished
poets of the eighteenth century will
be a fitting introduction to Wordsworth, and, indeed,
a kind of commentary on his poetry. Of
two of these poets we find very evident traces
in him—Thomson and Cowper—of the one in
an indiscriminating love of nature, of the other
in a kind of domestic purity, and of both in the
habit of treating subjects essentially prosaic, in
verse; whence a somewhat swelling wordiness is
inevitable.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thomson had the good luck to be born in Scotland,
and to be brought up by parents remarkable
for simplicity and piety of life. Living in the
country till he was nearly twenty, he learned to
love natural beauty, and must have been an attentive
student of scenery. That he had true instincts
in poetry is proved by his making Milton and
Spenser his models. He was a man of force and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
originality, and English poetry owes him a large
debt as the first who stood out both in precept and
practice against the vicious artificial style which
then reigned, and led the way back to purer tastes
and deeper principles. He was a man perfectly
pure in life; the associate of eminent and titled
personages, without being ashamed of the little milliner’s
shop of his sisters in Edinburgh; a lover of
freedom, and a poet who never lost a friend, nor
ever wrote a line of which he could repent. The
licentiousness of the age could not stain him. His
poem of “Winter” was published a year before the
appearance of the “Dunciad.”</p>

<p>Thomson’s style is not equal to his conceptions.
It is generally lumbering and diffuse, and rather
stilted than lofty. It is very likely that his Scotch
birth had something to do with this, and that he
could not write English with that unconsciousness
without which elegance is out of the question—for
there can be no true elegance without freedom.
Burns’s English letters and poems are examples
of this.</p>

<p>But there are passages in Thomson’s poems full
of the truest feelings for nature, and gleams of pure
imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell here read a passage from “Summer,”
which, he said, illustrated better than almost any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
other his excellences and defects. It is a description
of a storm, beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At first heard solemn o’er the verge of Heaven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tempest growls.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is fustian patched with cloth of gold. The
picture, fine as it is in parts, is too much frittered
with particulars. The poet’s imagination does not
seem powerful enough to control the language.
There is no autocratic energy, but the sentences
are like unruly barons, each doing what he likes in
his own province. Many of them are prosaic and
thoroughly <i>un</i>picturesque, and come under the fatal
condemnation of being <i>flat</i>. Yet throughout the
passage,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The unconquerable genius struggles through</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>half-suffocated in a cloud of words.</p>

<p>But the metre is hitchy and broken, and seems
to have no law but that of five feet to the verse.
There is no Pegasean soar, but the unwieldy gallop
of an ox. The imagination, which Thomson undoubtedly
had, contrasted oddly with the lumbering
vehicle of his diction. He takes a bushel-basket
to bring home an egg in. In him poetry
and prose entered into partnership, and poetry was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
the sleeping partner who comes down now and
then to see how the business is getting on. But he
had the <i>soul</i> of a poet, and that is the main thing.</p>

<p>Of Gray and Collins there is no occasion to speak
at length in this place. Both of them showed true
poetic imagination. In Gray it was thwarted by
an intellectual timidity that looked round continually
for precedent; and Collins did not live long
enough to discharge his mind thoroughly of classic
pedantry; but both of them broke away from the
reigning style of decorous frigidity. Collins’s “Ode
to Evening” is enough to show that he had a sincere
love of nature—but generally the scenery of
both is borrowed from books.</p>

<p>In Cowper we find the same over-minuteness in
describing which makes Thomson wearisome, but
relieved by a constant vivacity of fancy which in
Thomson was entirely wanting. But Cowper more
distinctly preluded Wordsworth in his delight in
simple things, in finding themes for his song in the
little incidents of his own fireside life, or his daily
walks, and especially in his desire to make poetry a
means of conveying moral truth. The influence of
Cowper may be traced clearly in some of Wordsworth’s
minor poems of pure fancy, and there is
one poem of his—that on “Yardly Oak”—which
is almost perfectly Wordsworthian. But Cowper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
rarely rises above the region of fancy, and he often
applied verse to themes that would not sing. His
poetry is never more than agreeable, and never
reaches down to the deeper sources of delight.
Cowper was one of those men who, wanting a vigorous
understanding to steady the emotional part
of his nature, may be called peculiar rather than
original. Great poetry can never be made out of
a morbid temperament, and great wits are commonly
the farthest removed from madness. But
Cowper had at least the power of believing that his
own thoughts and pleasures were as good, and as
fit for poetry, as those of any man, no matter how
long he had enjoyed the merit of being dead.</p>

<p>The closing years of the eighteenth century have
something in common with those of the sixteenth.
The air was sparkling with moral and intellectual
stimulus. The tremble of the French Revolution
ran through all Europe, and probably England,
since the time of the great Puritan revolt, had never
felt such a thrill of national and indigenous sentiment
as during the Napoleonic wars. It was a time
fitted to give birth to something original in literature.
If from the collision of minds sparks of
wit and fancy fly out, the shock and jostle of great
events, of world-shaping ideas, and of nations who
do their work without knowing it, strike forth a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
fire that kindles heart and brain and tongue to
more inspired conceptions and utterances.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for Wordsworth that he had his
breeding in the country, and not only so, but among
the grandest scenery of England. His earliest associates
were the mountains, lakes, and streams of
his native district, and the scenery with which his
mind was stored during its most impressionable
period was noble and pure. The people, also, among
whom he grew up were a simple and hardy race,
who kept alive the traditions and many of the
habits of a more picturesque time. There was also
a general equality of condition which kept life from
becoming conventional and trite, and which cherished
friendly human sympathies. When death
knocked at any door of the hamlet, there was an
echo from every fireside; and a wedding dropped an
orange blossom at every door. There was not a
grave in the little churchyard but had its story;
not a crag or glen or aged tree without its legend.
The occupations of the people, who were mostly
small farmers and shepherds, were such as fostered
independence and originality of character. And
where everybody knew everybody, and everybody’s
father had known everybody’s father, and so on
immemorially, the interest of man in man was not
likely to become a matter of cold hearsay and distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
report. It was here that Wordsworth learned
not only to love the simplicity of nature, but likewise
that homely and earnest manliness which
gives such depth and sincerity to his poems.
Travel, intercourse with society, scholarly culture,
nothing could cover up or obliterate those early impressions.
They widened with the range of his
knowledge and added to his power of expression,
but they never blunted that fine instinct in him
which enables him always to speak directly to men
and to gentleman, or scholar, or citizen. It was
this that enabled his poetry afterwards to conquer
all the reviews of England. The great art of
being a man, the sublime mystery of being <i>yourself</i>,
is something to which one must be apprenticed
early.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell here gave an outline of Wordsworth’s
personal history and character.</p>

<p>As a man we fancy him just in the least degree
uninteresting—if the horrid word must come out—why,
a little bit of a bore. One must regard him
as a prophet in order to have the right kind of feeling
toward him; and prophets are excellent for
certain moods of mind, but perhaps are creatures</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Too bright and good</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For human nature’s daily food.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>
<p>I fancy from what I have heard from those who
knew him that he had a tremendous prose-power,
and that, with his singing-robes off, he was dry and
stiff as a figure-head. He had a purity of mind
approaching almost to prudery, and a pupil of Dr.
Arnold told me he had heard him say once at dinner
that he thought the first line of Keats’s ode
to a “Grecian Urn” indecorous. The boys considered
him rather <i>slow</i>. There was something rocky
and unyielding in his mind; something that, if we
found it in a man we did not feel grateful to and
respect, we should call hard. Even his fancy sometimes
is glittering and stiff, like crystallizations in
granite. But at other times how tender and delicate
and dewy from very contrast, like harebells
growing in a crag-cleft!</p>

<p>There seem to have been two distinct natures in
him—Wordsworth the poet, and Wordsworth the
man who used to talk about Wordsworth the poet.
One played a kind of Baruch to the other’s Jeremiah,
and thought a great deal of his master the prophet.
Baruch was terrifically <i>un</i>inspired, and was in the
habit of repeating Jeremiah’s poems at rather more
length than was desired, selecting commonly the
parts which pleased him, Baruch, the best. Baruch
Wordsworth used to praise Jeremiah Wordsworth,
and used to tell entertaining anecdotes of him,—how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
he one day saw an old woman and the next
did <i>not</i>, and so came home and dictated some
verses on this remarkable phenomenon; and how
another day he saw a cow.</p>

<p>But in reading Wordsworth we must skip all the
Baruch interpolations, and cleave wholly to Jeremiah,
who is truly inspired and noble—more so
than any modern. We are too near him, perhaps,
to be able wholly to separate the personal from the
poetical. I acknowledge that I reverence the noble
old man both for his grand life and his poems, that
are worthy expressions of it. But a lecturer is
under bonds to speak what he believes to be the
truth. While I think that Wordsworth’s poetry is
a thing by itself, both in its heights and depths,
something sacred and apart, I cannot but acknowledge
that his prosing is sometimes a gift as peculiar
to himself. Like old Ben Jonson, he apparently
wished that a great deal of what he wrote
should be called “works.” Especially is this true
of his larger poems, like the “Excursion” and the
“Prelude.” However small, however commonplace
the thought, the ponderous machine of his verse
runs on like a railway train that must start at a
certain hour though the only passenger be the boy
that cries lozenges. He seems to have thought that
inspiration was something that could be turned on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
like steam. Walter Savage Landor told me that he
once said to Wordsworth: “Mr. Wordsworth, a man
may mix as much poetry with prose as he likes,
and it will make it the better; but the moment he
mixes a bit of prose with his poetry, it precipitates
the whole.” Wordsworth, he added, never
forgave him.</p>

<p>There was a great deal in Wordsworth’s character
that reminds us of Milton; the same self-reliance,
the same purity and loftiness of purpose, and, I suspect,
the same personal dryness of temperament
and seclusion of self. He seems to have had a profounder
imagination than Milton, but infinitely less
music, less poetical faculty. I am not entirely satisfied
of the truth of the modern philosophy which,
if a man knocks another on the head, transfers all
the guilt to some peccant bump on his own occiput
or sinciput; but if we measure Wordsworth in this
way, I feel as if he had plenty of forehead, but that
he wanted hind-head, and would have been more
entirely satisfactory if he had had one of the philo-something-or-other.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that in Wordsworth the very
highest powers of the poetical mind were associated
with a certain tendency to the diffuse and
commonplace. It is in the Understanding (always
prosaic) that the great golden veins of his imagination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
are embedded. He wrote too much to write
always well; for it is not a great Xerxes army of
words, but a compact Greek ten thousand that
march safely down to posterity. He sets tasks
to the divine faculty, which is much the same as
trying to make Jove’s eagle do the service of a
clucking hen. Throughout the “Prelude” and the
“Excursion,” he seems striving to bind the wizard
imagination with the sand-ropes of dry disquisition,
and to have forgotten the potent spell-word
which would make the particulars adhere. There
is an arenaceous quality in the style which makes
progress wearisome; yet with what splendors of
mountain-sunsets are we not rewarded! What
golden rounds of verse do we not see stretching
heavenward, with angels ascending and descending!
What haunting melodies hover around us,
deep and eternal, like the undying barytone of the
sea! And if we are compelled to fare through
sands and desert wilderness, how often do we not
hear airy shapes that syllable our names with a
startling personal appeal to our highest consciousness
and our noblest aspiration, such as we might
wait for in vain in any other poet.</p>

<p>Take from Wordsworth all which an honest criticism
cannot but allow, and what is left will show
how truly great he was. He had no humor, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
dramatic power, and his temperament was of that
dry and juiceless quality that in all his published
correspondence you shall not find a letter, but only
essays. If we consider carefully where he was
most successful, we shall find that it was not so
much in description of natural scenery, or delineation
of character, as in vivid expression of the effect
produced by external objects and events upon
his own mind. His finest passages are always
monologues. He had a fondness for particulars,
and there are parts of his poems which remind us
of local histories in the undue importance given to
trivial matter. He was the historian of Wordsworthshire.
This power of particularization (for it
is as truly a power as generalization) is what gives
such vigor and greatness to single lines and sentiments
of Wordsworth, and to poems developing a
single thought or word. It was this that made him
so fond of the sonnet. His mind had not that
reach and elemental movement of Milton’s which,
like the trade-winds, gathered to itself thoughts
and images like stately fleets from every quarter;
some, deep with silks and spicery, come brooding
over the silent thunders of their battailous armaments,
but all swept forward in their destined
track, over the long billows of his verse, every inch
of canvas strained by the unifying breath of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
common epic impulse. It was an organ that Milton
mastered, mighty in compass, capable equally of
the trumpet’s ardors, or the slim delicacy of the
flute; and sometimes it bursts forth in great
crashes through his prose, as if he touched it for
solace in the intervals of his toil. If Wordsworth
sometimes puts the trumpet to his lips, yet he lays it
aside soon and willingly for his appropriate instrument,
the pastoral reed. And it is not one that
grew by any vulgar stream, but that which Apollo
breathed through tending the flocks of Admetus,
that which Pan endowed with every melody of the
visible universe, the same in which the soul of the
despairing nymph took refuge and gifted with her
dual nature, so that ever and anon, amid notes of
human joy and sorrow, there comes suddenly a
deeper and almost awful tone, thrilling us into dim
consciousness of a forgotten divinity.</p>

<p>Of no other poet, except Shakspeare, have so
many phrases become household words as of
Wordsworth. If Pope has made current more epigrams
of worldly wisdom, to Wordsworth belongs
the nobler praise of having defined for us, and
given us for a daily possession, those faint and
vague suggestions of other-worldliness of whose
gentler ministry with our baser nature the hurry
and bustle of life scarcely ever allowed us to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
conscious. He has won for himself a secure immortality
by a depth of intuition which makes only
the best minds at their best hours worthy, or indeed
capable, of his companionship, and by a homely
sincerity of human sympathy which reaches the
humblest heart. Our language owes him gratitude
for the purity and abstinence of his style, and we
who speak it, for having emboldened us to trust
ourselves to take delight in simple things, and to
trust ourselves to our own instincts. And he hath
his reward. It needs not to</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Friday Evening, February 16, 1855</i>)</p>
<hr class="r5">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p class="center big">XII</p>
</div>


<p>Whether, as some philosophers here assume,
we possess only the fragments of a great
cycle of knowledge, in whose center stood the
primeval man in friendly relation with the powers
of the universe, and build our hovels out of the ruins
of our ancestral palace; or whether, according to
the developing theory of others, we are rising gradually
and have come up from an atom instead of
descending from an Adam, so that the proudest
pedigree might run up to a barnacle or a zoöphyte
at last, are questions which will keep for a good
many centuries yet. Confining myself to what little
we can learn from History, we find tribes rising
slowly out of barbarism to a higher or lower point
of culture and civility, and everywhere the poet also
is found under one name or another, changing in
certain outward respects, but essentially the same.</p>

<p>But however far we go back, we shall find this
also—that the poet and the priest were united
originally in the same person: which means that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
the poet was he who was conscious of the world of
spirit as well as that of sense, and was the ambassador
of the gods to men. This was his highest
function, and hence his name of seer.</p>

<p>I suppose the word <i>epic</i> originally meant nothing
more than this, that the poet was the person who
was the greatest master of speech. His were the
ἔπεα πτερόεντα, the true winged words that could fly
down the unexplored future and carry thither the
names of ancestral heroes, of the brave, and wise,
and good. It was thus that the poet could reward
virtue, and, by and by, as society grew more complex,
could burn in the brand of shame. This is
Homer’s character of Demodocus in the eighth
book of the “Odyssey,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When the Muse loved and gave the good and ill,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the gift of conferring good or evil immortality.</p>

<p>The first histories were in verse, and, sung as
they were at the feasts and gatherings of the people,
they awoke in men the desire of fame, which
is the first promoter of courage and self-trust, because
it teaches men by degrees to appeal from the
present to the future. We may fancy what the
influence of the early epics was when they were
recited to men who claimed the heroes celebrated
in them for their ancestors, by what Bouchardon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
the sculptor, said only two centuries ago: “When
I read Homer I feel as if I were twenty feet high.”</p>

<p>Nor have poets lost their power over the future
in modern times. Dante lifts up by the hair the
face of some petty traitor, the Smith and Brown of
some provincial Italian town, lets the fire of his Inferno
glare upon it for a moment, and it is printed
forever on the memory of mankind. The historians
may iron out the shoulders of Richard III.
as smooth as they can; they will never get over
the wrench that Shakspeare gave them.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of almost all early literature is
that it seems to have a double meaning; that underneath
its natural we find ourselves continually
seeing and suspecting a supernatural meaning.
Even in the older epics the characters seem to be
only half-historical and half-typical. They appear
as the Pilgrim Fathers do in Twenty-second of December
speeches at Plymouth. The names may be
historical, but the attributes are ideal. The orator
draws a portrait rather of what he thinks the
founders ought to have been than a likeness which
contemporaries would have recognized. Thus did
early poets endeavor to make reality out of appearances.
For, except a few typical men in whom
certain ideas get embodied, the generations of mankind
are mere apparitions who come out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
dark for a purposeless moment, and enter the
dark again after they have performed the nothing
they came for.</p>

<p>The poet’s gift, then, is that of seer. He it is
that discovers the truth as it exists in types and
images; that is the spiritual meaning, which abides
forever under the sensual. And his instinct is to
express himself also in types and images. But it
was not only necessary that he himself should be
delighted with his vision, but that he should interest
his hearers with the faculty divine. Pure truth
is not acceptable to the mental palate. It must be
diluted with character and incident; it must be humanized
in order to be attractive. If the bones of
a mastodon be exhumed, a crowd will gather out of
curiosity; but let the skeleton of a man be turned
up, and what a difference in the expression of the
features! Every bystander then creates his little
drama, in which those whitened bones take flesh
upon them and stalk as chief actor.</p>

<p>The poet is he who can best see or best say what
is ideal; what belongs to the world of soul and of
beauty. Whether he celebrates the brave and good,
or the gods, or the beautiful as it appears in man
or nature, something of a religious character still
clings to him. He may be unconscious of his mission;
he may be false to it, but in proportion as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
is a great poet, he rises to the level of it more often.
He does not always directly rebuke what is
bad or base, but indirectly, by making us feel what
delight there is in the good and fair. If he besiege
evil it is with such beautiful engines of war (as Plutarch
tells us of Demetrius) that the besieged themselves
are charmed with them. Whoever reads the
great poets cannot but be made better by it, for
they always introduce him to a higher society, to a
greater style of manners and of thinking. Whoever
learns to love what is beautiful is made incapable
of the mean and low and bad. It is something to
be thought of, that all the great poets have been
good men. He who translates the divine into the
vulgar, the spiritual into the sensual, is the reverse
of a poet.</p>

<p>It seems to be thought that we have come upon
the earth too late; that there has been a feast of the
imagination formerly, and all that is left for us is
to steal the scraps. We hear that there is no poetry
in railroads, steamboats, and telegraphs, and especially
in Brother Jonathan. If this be true, so much
the worse for him. But, because <i>he</i> is a materialist,
shall there be no poets? When we have said that
we live in a materialistic age, we have said something
which meant more than we intended. If we
say it in the way of blame, we have said a foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
thing, for probably one age is as good as another;
and, at any rate, the worst is good enough company
for us. The age of Shakspeare seems richer
than our own only because he was lucky enough to
have such a pair of eyes as his to see it and such a
gift as his to report it. Shakspeare did not sit
down and cry for the water of Helicon to turn the
wheels of his little private mill there at the Bankside.
He appears to have gone more quietly about
his business than any playwright in London; to
have drawn off what water-power he wanted from
the great prosy current of affairs that flows alike
for all, and in spite of all; to have ground for the
public what grist they want, coarse or fine; and it
seems a mere piece of luck that the smooth stream
of his activity reflected with ravishing clearness
every changing mood of heaven and earth, every
stick and stone, every dog and clown and courtier
that stood upon its brink. It is a curious illustration
of the friendly manner in which Shakspeare
received everything that came along, of what a
<i>present</i> man he was, that in the very same year
that the mulberry tree was brought into England,
he got one and planted it in his garden at Stratford.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that this is a materialistic age,
and for this very reason we want our poets all the
more. We find that every generation contrives to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
catch its singing larks without the sky’s falling.
When the poet comes he always turns out to be the
man who discovers that the passing moment is the
inspired one, and that the secret of poetry is not to
have lived in Homer’s day or Dante’s, but to be
alive now. To be alive now, that is the great art
and mystery. They are dead men who live in the
past, and men yet unborn who live in the future.
We are like Hans-in-Luck, forever exchanging the
burthensome good we have for something else, till
at last we come home empty-handed. The people
who find their own age prosaic are those who see
only its costume. And this is what makes it prosaic:
that we have not faith enough in ourselves to
think that our own clothes are good enough to be
presented to Posterity in. The artists seem to
think that the court dress of posterity is that of
Vandyke’s time or Cæsar’s. I have seen the model
of a statue of Sir Robert Peel—a statesman whose
merit consisted in yielding gracefully to the present—in
which the sculptor had done his best to
travesty the real man into a make-believe Roman.
At the period when England produced its greatest
poets, we find exactly the reverse of this, and we
are thankful to the man who made the monument
of Lord Bacon that he had genius enough to copy
every button of his dress, everything down to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
rosettes on his shoes. These men had faith even in
their own shoe-strings. Till Dante’s time the Italian
poets thought no language good enough to put
their nothings into but Latin (and, indeed, a dead
tongue was the best for dead thoughts), but Dante
found the common speech of Florence, in which
men bargained, and scolded, and made love, good
enough for him, and out of the world around him
made such a poem as no Roman ever sang.</p>

<p>We cannot get rid of our wonder, we who have
brought down the wild lightning from writing fiery
doom upon the walls of heaven to be our errand-boy
and penny postman. In this day of newspapers
and electric telegraphs, in which common-sense
and ridicule can magnetise a whole continent
between dinner and tea, we may say that such a
phenomenon as Mahomet were impossible; and behold
Joe Smith and the State of Deseret! Turning
over the yellow leaves of the same copy of Webster
on “Witchcraft” which Cotton Mather studied, I
thought, Well, that goblin is laid at last! And
while I mused, the tables were dancing and the
chairs beating the devil’s tattoo all over Christendom.
I have a neighbor who dug down through
tough strata of clay-slate to a spring pointed out by
a witch-hazel rod in the hands of a seventh son’s
seventh son, and the water is sweeter to him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
the wonder that is mixed with it. After all, it
seems that our scientific gas, be it never so brilliant,
is not equal to the dingy old Aladdin’s lamp.</p>

<p>It is impossible for men to live in the world without
poetry of some sort or another. If they cannot
get the best, they will get at some substitute for it.
But there is as much poetry as ever in the world if
we can ever know how to find it out; and as much
imagination, perhaps, only that it takes a more prosaic
direction. Every man who meets with misfortune,
who is stripped of his material prosperity,
finds that he has a little outlying mountain-farm of
imagination, which does not appear in the schedule
of his effects, on which his spirit is able to keep
alive, though he never thought of it while he was
fortunate. Job turns out to be a great poet as soon
as his flocks and herds are taken away from him.</p>

<p>Perhaps our continent will begin to sing by and
by, as the others have done. We have had the
Practical forced upon us by our condition. We
have had a whole hemisphere to clear up and put
to rights. And we are descended from men who
were hardened and stiffened by a downright wrestle
with Necessity. There was no chance for poetry
among the Puritans. And yet if any people have a
right to imagination, it should be the descendants
of those very Puritans. They had enough of it, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
they could not have conceived the great epic they
did, whose books are States, and which is written
on this continent from Maine to California.</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams, making a speech at New
Bedford many years ago, reckoned the number of
whale ships (if I remember rightly) that sailed out
of that port, and, comparing it with some former
period, took it as a type of American success. But,
alas! it is with quite other oil that those far-shining
lamps of a nation’s true glory which burn forever
must be filled. It is not by any amount of material
splendor or prosperity, but only by moral greatness,
by ideas, by works of the imagination, that a race
can conquer the future. No voice comes to us from
the once mighty Assyria but the hoot of the owl
that nests amid her crumbling palaces; of Carthage,
whose merchant fleets once furled their sails in
every port of the known world, nothing is left but
the deeds of Hannibal. She lies dead on the shore
of her once subject sea, and the wind of the desert
flings its handfuls of burial-sand upon her corpse.
A fog can blot Holland or Switzerland out of existence.
But how large is the space occupied in the
maps of the soul by little Athens or powerless Italy.
They were great by the soul, and their vital force is
as indestructible as the soul.</p>

<p>Till America has learned to love Art, not as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
amusement, not as a mere ornament of her cities, not
as a superstition of what is <i>comme il faut</i> for a great
nation, but for its harmonizing and ennobling energy,
for its power of making men better by arousing
in them the perception of their own instincts for what
is beautiful and sacred and religious, and an eternal
rebuke of the base and worldly, she will not have
succeeded in that high sense which alone makes a
nation out of a people, and raises it from a dead name
to a living power. Were our little mother-island
sunk beneath the sea; or worse, were she conquered
by Scythian barbarians, yet Shakspeare would be
an immortal England, and would conquer countries
when the bones of her last sailor had kept their
ghastly watch for ages in unhallowed ooze beside
the quenched thunders of her navy.</p>

<p>This lesson I learn from the past: that grace and
goodness, the fair, the noble, and the true will never
cease out of the world till the God from whom they
emanate ceases out of it; that the sacred duty and
noble office of the poet is to reveal and justify them
to man; that as long as the soul endures, endures
also the theme of new and unexampled song; that
while there is grace in grace, love in love, and
beauty in beauty, God will still send poets to find
them, and bear witness of them, and to hang their
ideal portraitures in the gallery of memory. <i>God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
with us</i> is forever the mystical theme of the hour
that is passing. The lives of the great poets teach
us that they were men of their generation who felt
most deeply the meaning of the Present.</p>

<p>I have been more painfully conscious than any
one else could be of the inadequacy of what I have
been able to say, when compared to the richness
and variety of my theme. I shall endeavor to
make my apology in verse, and will bid you farewell
in a little poem in which I have endeavored to
express the futility of all <i>effort</i> to speak the loveliness
of things, and also my theory of where the
Muse is to be found, if ever. It is to her that I
sing my hymn.</p>

<p>Mr. Lowell here read an original poem of considerable
length, which concluded the lecture, and
was received with bursts of applause.
